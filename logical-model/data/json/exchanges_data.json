                "description": "## What Is QuickSwap?\n\nQuickSwap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) that runs on Polygon Network to offer cheaper and faster transactions. Its [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) integrates upgradeable [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and renders [intermediaries](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/intermediary-middleman) obsolete. The exchange is based on open-source software and prioritizes decentralization, [censorship resistance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/censorship-resistance) and security. It benefits from ultra-low gas prices compared to Ethereum, as well as fast and simple trading execution.    \n\nAnyone can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) by depositing two tokens into a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). The exchange enables the trading of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens, which are traded according to the constant product formula. The mechanism removes the need for an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) and allows traders to tap into a constant pool of liquidity. \n\nLiquidity providers can passively invest their assets to accumulate trading fees or provide liquidity as a hedge for certain trading strategies. Traders use tools like [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) or can deploy arbitrage bots to compare prices across different exchanges. Finally, developers integrate the exchange with different liquidity aggregators or [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hot-wallet).\n\n\n## Who Are the QuickSwap Founders?\n\nQuickSwap was founded by Roc Zacharias, who is also the CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a blockchain marketing and consultancy firm that also acts as an advisor to the exchange. It is furthermore advised by the Matic Foundation, a governing body of the Polygon blockchain. \n\n\n## When Did QuickSwap Launch?\n\nQuickSwap launched in May 2021 with over 96% of the tokens distributed to the community. It is now considered the main decentralized exchange for Polygon, a [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solution for Ethereum. \n\n\n## Where Is QuickSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange doesn\u2019t provide any information about its headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## QuickSwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## QuickSwap Supported Coins List \n\nQuickSwap supports all ERC-20 tokens deployed on Polygon, including wrapped tokens like [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin). \n\n\n## How Much Are QuickSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges a 0.3% fee for swapping tokens, which is distributed among liquidity providers on a pro-rata basis. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on QuickSwap?\n\nThere is no margin or [leverage trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-leverage-in-crypto-trading-and-how-to-use-it) option on this exchange.

While maker fees vary from 0% to 0.10%, taker fees are between 0.02% and 0.20%.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Okcoin?\n\nTraders can use margin to trade with up to 3x leverage on the exchange.\n\n## What new local currencies can I use to buy and sell crypto?\n\nYou will soon be able to use EUR to transact on Okcoin.

                "description": "## What Is Zaif?\n\nZaif is a Japanese centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX). It was one of the first crypto exchanges to obtain a license from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA). As of September 2018, it was ranked as the 35th largest cryptocurrency exchange by turnover. However, on September 14, 2018, the exchange\u2019s hot wallets were hacked, with the equivalent of $60 million in cryptocurrency stolen.\n\nFollowing the incident, Zaif suspended operations, entering a bailout agreement with FISCO, a Japanese brokerage that injected 5 billion yen ($44.675 million) in financial support. In November, the company was sold to FISCO Digital Asset Group Co. Ltd.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Zaif?\n\nThe company was founded by Takao Asayama, CEO of Tech Bureau. Tech Bureau operated Zaif until FISCO purchased it in late 2018. At the time of publication, Ryuji Yagi headed the platform. Other members of the management team include Toshiya Kotake, Norifumi Imai, Takayoshi Abe, Kenji Yamaguchi, and Osamu Fukami.\n\nCoinMarketCap could not confirm the background of these individuals since the majority of them do not have LinkedIn profiles.\n\n\n## When Did Zaif Launch?\n\nZaif made its debut on June 16, 2014.\n\n\n## Where Is Zaif Located?\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange operates out of Japan\u2019s busy capital city of Tokyo.\n\n\n## Zaif Restricted Countries\n\nCoinMarketCap has been unable to confirm if any countries are restricted from using Zaif. However, besides the fact that the exchange is mostly in Japanese, an August 2022 announcement from the company said that the platform was \u201ccurrently not accepting applications for opening an account for customers residing overseas. In addition, even if you are a customer who has completed identity verification in the past, we may refuse to use it at our discretion.\u201d\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Zaif?\n\nThe trading platform offers a limited number of digital assets. With just ten coins and 14 markets, BTC/JPY is the most active trading pair on the exchange.\n\n\n## How Much Are Zaif Fees?\n\nZaif charges some of the lowest fees in the cryptocurrency exchange market \u2014 0.10% for takers and free of charge for makers for its spot trading market.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Zaif?\n\nUsers can trade on margin with a leverage of up to 7.7x on the exchange platform.",

                "description": "## What Is Coinbase Exchange?\n\nCoinbase Exchange is a US-based crypto trading and investment platform where users can easily buy, sell, exchange and store cryptocurrencies. The platform is intuitive and beginner-friendly with support for basic transactions, digital wallet, and PayPal withdrawals. For more advanced traders, Coinbase Pro offers more professional trade execution and lower fees. However, in June 2022, the company announced that Coinbase Pro will be phased out and all users will have access to the \u201cAdvanced Trade\u201d feature on the main app.\n\n\n## Who Are the Coinbase Exchange Founders?\n\nThe project was established by former Airbnb engineer Brian Armstrong and former Goldman Sachs trader Fred Ehrsam in 2012.\n\nBrian Armstrong is CEO of the company. He graduated from Rice University, Texas with a bachelor's degree in economics & computer science, and later received a master's degree in computer science as well. Armstrong began his career as a developer at IBM, worked as a consultant for Deloitte, and then joined Airbnb as a software engineer. \n\nCo-founder of Coinbase Global, Fred Ehrsam attended Duke University in North Carolina and graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in economics. He left Coinbase in 2017, retaining his seat on the board of directors. In 2018, he co-founded cryptocurrency investment firm Paradigm.\n\n\n## When Did Coinbase Exchange Launch?\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. was established in June 2012 in San Francisco, California, U.S.\n\n\n## Where Is Coinbase Exchange Located?\n\nThe company has gained the trust of US regulators, although it doesn\u2019t have a physical head office and all employees work remotely.\n\n\n## Coinbase Exchange Restricted Countries\n\nCoinbase is available in over 100 countries, although some functions may be restricted in certain areas. The entire list can be viewed on the official website.\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Coinbase Exchange?\n\nOver 150 crypto assets can be traded on the online platform, including popular options like BTC, ETH, AVAX, SOL, ADA, USDC, DOGE, MATIC and USDT.\n\n\n## How Much Are Coinbase Exchange Fees?\n\nExchange fees are based on a maker-taker model and range from 0.00% to 0.40% for maker fees, and 0.05% to 0.60% for taker fees, depending on the total USD trailing 30-day trading volume. \u201cStable Pairs,\u201d or trading pairs of stablecoins have fixed maker fee of 0.00% and taker fee of 0.001%.\n\nFiat deposit fees ranges from free (ACH), $10 USD (Wire), \u20ac0.15 EUR (SEPA) and free (SWIFT) and withdrawal fees vary from free (ACH), $25 USD (Wire), \u20ac0.15 EUR (SEPA) and \u00a31 GBP (SWIFT).\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Coinbase Exchange?\n\nIn February 2020, it was announced that Coinbase Pro customers can access up to 3X leverage on USD-quoted books. But in November 2020, margin trading was disabled due to changes in the regulatory environment.",

Moreover, the exchange does not provide services for accounts located in Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Crimea and Sevastopol, Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, Luhansk People\u2019s Republic of Ukraine, Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Seychelles, Bermuda, Japan, Ontario Canada, and Quebec Canada.\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on BitMEX?\n\nBitMEX is one of the leading crypto derivatives exchanges where users can purchase [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures)/[perpetual](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/perpetual-contracts) contracts on a wide variety of assets like BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, SOL, ADA, BCH, BNB, LINK, DOT. The derivatives platform supports more crypto choices than the spot one.\n\n## How Much Are BitMEX Fees?\n\nThe exchange uses the maker & taker model. The trading fee on BitMEX starts at 0.025%. For spot trading, the fees are 0.01% for makers and 0.075% for takers. As for derivatives, the trading fees are 0.075% for takers, and makers receive a 0.01% rebate.

After leaving Korbit, Lyu joined SoftBank as a Venture Partner.\n\nOh Se-jin is Korbit's current CEO.\n\n## When Did Korbit Launch?\n\nThe company was established back in July 2013. In 2017, it was acquired by Korean game developer Nexon.\n\n## Where Is Korbit Located?\n\nKorbit is headquartered in Gangnam-gu, a district in Seoul, South Korea.\n\n## Korbit Restricted Countries\n\nThe exchange is available only to South Korean residents since the interface language is Korean, and the main fiat currency is KRW. In 2022, Korbit and several other Korean exchanges blocked Russian IP addresses.\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Korbit?\n\nInitially, Korbit's activity was limited to BTC/KRW trading, but over time, the project expanded the asset base. Currently, the platform provides access to various cryptos, among them: BTC, ETH, XRP, XLM, BCH, BNB, EOS, LTC, LINK, FIL, SOL, SAND, MANA, USDC, ADA, DOGE, DAI, DOT and many others. Digital assets are paired with KRW (the Korean Won).\n\n## How Much Are Korbit Fees?\n\nUsers can buy/sell cryptocurrencies with commissions below the market average. Trading fees depend on the trading volume for a period of 30 days. The higher the volume, the lower the commission. The maker fee is 0.08%, while the taker fee is 0.2% (in case the volume is less than 100 million KRW). If the monthly [trading volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/trade-volume) is more than 100 billion KRW, the maker fee is free, the taker fee is 0.01%. Deposits on the Korbit exchange are free. The platform charges a fee for withdrawing BTC, which is 0.0001 BTC.\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Korbit?\n\n[Margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading) is not available.",

Rates are based on a maker-taker model.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Gate.io?\n\nGate.io offers to its clients margin trading with 10X leverage. The volume of the margin loan is determined by the leverage ratio: the exchange provides leverage ratios from 3X to 10X, which varies from market to market.\n",

                "description": "### What is Digitra.com?\n\nDigitra.com is a global digital assets centralized exchange. It was born to bring the convergence between Traditional and Digital Assets ecosystems, with reliable systems provided by top tier global suppliers, compliance frameworks and regulatory engagement.\n\nDigitra.com is backed by partnerships with world class institutions as NASDAQ (first digital assets exchange to use Nasdaq Universal Matching Service engine globally), Fireblocks (Multi-layer security providing one-of-a-kind insurance policy that covers digital assets), and Veriff (AIpowered identity verification and KYC solution, with a fraud prevention engine).\n\n### Who are Digitra.com founders?\n\nDigitra.com executes this convergence led by a seasoned executive with hands-on experience in the market. Digitra.com\u2019s founder Rodrigo Batista is the former CEO (2013-2018), founder and controlling shareholder of Mercado Bitcoin, then the largest crypto exchange in Latin America, which he took from zero to 1.2 million clients in 5 years. Rodrigo sold his stake in the company in 2019.\n\nRodrigo is also the co-founder of the token issuer nTokens, the technology infrastructure company Atris, the security tokens exchange Estar, and the insurance company 88i. All these businesses are connected with the crypto and tokenization universe.\n\nThrough the advisory of Rothschild & Co, Profitus Fund, owned by Ricardo Villela Marino, the controlling partner of Ita\u00fa Bank, has invested 5 million dollars in Digitra.com in May 2022.\n\n### When Did Digitra.com launch?\n\nThe exchange was launched in August 2022. In May 2023 its native token (DGTA) was launched, which is at core of its business model.\n\n### What coins are supported on Digitra.com?\n\nThe exchange lists over 30 cryptocurrencies and supports more than 60 trading pairs, including BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, TON, ADA and DGTA, among others.\n\n### How much are Digitra.com fees?\n\nTrading fees for any crypto pair on Digitra.com is 0.1% for market makers and 0.5% for market takers.\n\n### How is  Digitra.com traction/growth?\n\nSince the Digitra.com platform was launched in Aug/22, there were +150,000 downloads of the app, +150,000 people registered, from 200 countries, with +95,000 completing the KYC process. Digitra.com community engagement has been increasing steadily reaching ~6,000 members at Telegram.\n\n### What is Digitra.com Token (DGTA)?\n\nDGTA (Digitra.com Token) is an ERC-20 utility token based on the Ethereum blockchain with a maximum supply of 300 million units minted at once. DGTA is Digitra.com's loyalty program, fuelling the exchange\u2019s ecosystem across the board, which represents its main utility.\n\nDGTA holders benefit from the exchange\u2019s business performance given that Digitra.com uses part of its revenues to buy DGTA tokens on the market and burn them (Buyback & Burn program).\n\nAt the beginning, DGTA granted fee discounts to holders, similar to other exchange tokens in the market. However, it evolved to a loyalty program, in which holders get rewards throughout their journey at Digitra.com:\n\n* Creating account airdrop\n* Referring new customers airdrop\n* Getting more DGTA by only holding it at the platform\n* Getting more DGTA by providing liquidity at DGTA order book through open limit orders\n* Getting more DGTA by trading any crypto at the platform (daily Trade to Earn airdrop program)\n* DGTA holders benefit from the exchange\u2019s business performance given that Digitra.com uses part of its revenues to buy DGTA tokens on the market and burn them (monthly Buyback & Burn program)\n\nOne important characteristic of DGTA tokens is that the number of tokens airdropped by each program is fixed, thus limiting the supply of tokens over the time.\n\nAdditionally,  in the near future, DGTA holders will benefit from access to new products and new commercial initiatives.\n\nAs mentioned before, customers get DGTA for free in three ways:\n\nOpening an account: 100 tokens are airdropped every hour among all new customers. Digitra.com allocated up to 32,600,000 DGTA to this airdrop.\n\n15,000 tokens are airdropped daily, divided between the order books available on the platform. The tokens allocated to the order book are divided among the traders in that book, as follows: 75% of the distribution goes to the customers who traded the most, and the remaining 25% is distributed equally among all customers trading in that order book. Digitra.com allocated up to 28,893,000 DGTA to this airdrop.\n\n5,000 tokens are airdropped daily, of which 1,000 are distributed equally among all referred customers, and 4,000 to referrers. The top referrers get 3,000 according to the number of referrals they make, and 1,000 is distributed equally among all referrers in a given day. The referred customer needs to trade at least US$ 5 to both the referrer and the referee to receive the reward. The referral program is under the 60,000,000 DGTA for Marketing & Liquidity allocation.\n\nBurn & Buyback Policy\n\nAs an initiative to benefit holders and promote deflation, Digitra.com will regularly burn certain amounts of DGTA. Also, Digitra.com will regularly buyback certain amounts of DGTA, which may be added to the burn amount alongside fees in DGTA collected in the period.  \n\nDGTA Trading\n\nDTGA is available for trading at Digitra.com on two order books: DGTA-USDT and DGTA-BRL. DGTA is also available for trading at Uniswap on DGTA-ETH liquidity pool.",

A rebranding effort was set in motion on March 22, 2021, as part of an initiative to become the leading financial platform for cryptocurrencies, combining the strengths of a centralized trading platform with DeFi.\n\nDriven by its continuous product development and early-mover advantage in strategic alignment with the DeFi ecosystem, AscendEX offers trading services across over 200 trading pairs across cash, margin, and futures products, in particular margin trading of over 50 tokens in cross-asset collateral mode and futures trading in both cross-asset and isolated margin modes.\n\nOn December 11, 2021, malicious actors managed to access the exchange\u2019s hot wallets, reportedly stealing $77.7 million across three chains \u2013 Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Ascendex?\n\nAscendEX was founded by Dr. Jing Cao. He has garnered experience working as the Chief Investment Officer at Delpha Capital Management LLC, Chief Executive Officer for HD Consulting Services Group, Inc., and Portfolio Manager at Knight Capital Group, Inc. Jing Cao received an undergraduate degree from the University of Science & Technology of China and a doctorate from The University of Chicago.\n\n\n## When Did AscendEX Launch?\n\nThe company launched under the \"BitMax\" name in August 2018.\n\n\n## Where Is AscendEX Located?\n\nThe company is headquartered in Singapore.\n\n\n## AscendEX Restricted Countries\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s terms of service, its services are not offered to residents of Singapore, China (Mainland), the US, and \u201cfive US permanently inhabited territories - Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in the North Pacific Ocean, and American Samoa in the South Pacific Ocean.\u201d Furthermore, the services are restricted for citizens and residents of regions where crypto trading is banned.\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Ascendex?\n\nOver 250 digital assets are listed on the exchange. Customers can trade on more than 320 pairs.\n\n\n## How Much Are Ascendex Fees?\n\nThere are 9 VIP levels determined by the 30-day trade volume and 30-day average ASD holdings of a user. The transaction fees are based on the user\u2019s VIP level. For large market cap assets, the fees are 0-0.1% for makers and 0.02-0.1% for takers. The maker fees are 0-0.2%, while the taker fees make up 0.02-0.2% for other altcoins.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Ascendex?\n\nAscendEX allows margin trading, with leverage of up to 3X, 5X, 10X and 25X.",

                "slug": "dydx",
                "description": "## What Is dYdX?\n\ndYdX is the developer of a leading non-custodial [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) focused on advanced crypto products \u2014 namely [derivatives](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/derivatives-market) like crypto [perpertuals](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/perpetual-contracts). dYdX runs on audited [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) on blockchains like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), which eliminates the need of trusted intermediaries. The origins of the name is obtained from the mathematical derivative equation: dy/dx, a measure of rate of change. The DEX launched its own native token \u2014 [$DYDX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dydx/) \u2014 in August 2021, to function as a [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) for voting on proposals and as rewards for traders based on their trading volume on the platform.\n\nTo scale trading, dYdX and [StarkWare](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-starkware-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-starkware-starknet-and-starkex-ecosystem) launched a custom-built [layer 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) (L2) protocol for cross-margined perpetuals on Feb. 24, 2021. It is based on StarkWare\u2019s StarkEx scalability engine, based on[ zero-knowledge rollup](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zero-knowledge-rollups) (zk-Rollup) technology, and dYdX\u2019s perpetual smart contracts. Traders can now trade with zero [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas) costs, lower trading fees and reduced minimum trade sizes.\n\nAs of June 2022, dYdX has announced that for v4, they will launch their own independent blockchain based on [Cosmos](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-cosmos-network-and-the-cosmos-ecosystem) SDK and Tendermint PoS. The team stated the motivation behind their move was the speed and other centralization concerns surrounding Ethereum L2. The team believes that this switch will help them improve their performance and meet their goal of total decentralization by the end of the year. \n\n### Who Is the Founder of dYdX?\n\nAntonio Juliano, a former Uber developer and Coinbase software engineer founded the platform in 2017, and the protocol launched in 2019. Juliano studied Computer Science at Princeton and left university with a desire to work on tech startups. Working at Coinbase, he grew excited about Ethereum and hoped to build something atop the network. Initially building a [decentralized application](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) (DApps) search engine, Juliano decided to introduce margin trading into the [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) world and conceived the idea for dYdX.\n\n### Where Is dYdX Located?\n\nThe headquarters is in San Francisco. However, the team behind the protocol recently launched the dYdX Foundation which is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. Users can access the exchange from all over the globe, except from the following countries: Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Burma, Libya, Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote D\u2019ivoire and Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Zimbabwe and any country that is currently being sanctioned by the U.S.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on dYdX?\n\nAt the time of writing, the list of popular perpetual trading pairs on dYdX includes [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) and [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/).\n\n### How Much Are dYdX Exchange Fees?\n\ndYdX does not charge any deposit or withdrawal fees, and no gas fees are charged when trading on layer 2. However, the protocol employs a maker-taker fee structure that determines and weighs trade fees by volume. With their trade fee model, holders can receive fee discounts based on the size of their current holdings. \n\n### Is It Possible To Leverage or Margin Trade on dYdX?\n\nAt the time of writing, traders can go long or short with 20X leverage on BTC and ETH markets, and 10X on all other markets.",

Gas fees and MEV are minimized on Vertex due to the batched transaction and optimistic rollup model of the underlying Arbitrum layer two (L2), where Vertex\u2019s smart contracts control the risk engine and core products.\n\nVertex is non-custodial, meaning users always retain control over their assets on-chain.\nVertex boasts extremely low-latency trading and effective liquidity utilization across a broader range of DeFi assets as a byproduct of its hybrid orderbook-AMM design. The off-chain sequencer architecture also helps to minimize the Miner Extractable Value (MEV) characteristic of Ethereum L1 while enabling lightning-fast trading.\n\nThe integrated AMM is located on-chain \u2013 housed within the protocol layer. The on-chain AMM functions as the default state of the protocol controlled at the smart contract level, known as \u201cSlo-Mo Mode.\u201d",

                "description": "## What Is the dYdX Chain?\n\nThe dYdX Chain is a proof-of-stake blockchain network built using the Cosmos SDK and leveraging CometBFT for consensus. The dYdX Chain features; Enhanced speed and finality of trades with over [2000 tp/s](https://twitter.com/dYdX/status/1730279215944085883), full decentralization of the orderbook and matching engine, fully [open sourced](https://dydx.exchange/blog/dydx-chain-open-source-code) from the protocol to front end and an enhanced reward systems for users and community members alike. Rewards on the dYdX Chain comprise; (a) Trading Rewards in DYDX, (b) Staking Rewards predominantly in USDC and (c) an initial 6 Month Launch Incentive Program 20M USD in DYDX, proposed by Chaos Labs and approved by the community. If you want to read more about the dYdX Chain reward mechanisms read this [blog](https://www.dydx.foundation/blog/understanding-rewards-and-fees-on-the-dydx-chain).\n\nAs a PoS blockchain the dYdX Chain requires a layer 1 token to secure and govern the network. The dYdX community [voted](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x17026e18317dc29fe745d3130246a83b1485612da9c97e7261e8f659cf33663c) to adopt DYDX as the L1 protocol token for the dYdX Chain on September 2, 2023.\n\nHolders of the DYDX token can use their tokens to run a Validator or stake their tokens to a Validator in order to participate in securing and governing the dYdX Chain network.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of dYdX?\n\n[Antonio Juliano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniojuliano/) \u2014 an experienced programmer with a background in blockchain technology is the founder and CEO of dYdX. Antonio first entered the crypto space in 2015 as a software engineer at [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/ru/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/) \u2014 a cryptocurrency exchange platform. As a Princeton University graduate with a degree in computer science, Antonio embarked on his entrepreneurial journey and founded dYdX in early 2017. \n\n## Where Is dYdX Located?\n\nThe headquarters of dYdX Trading Inc are located in New York. The dYdX Foundation, responsible for launching the DYDX token, is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. Users can access the exchange from all over the globe, except from the following countries: Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Burma, Libya, Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote D\u2019ivoire and Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Zimbabwe, United Kingdom, Canada and any country that is currently being sanctioned by the U.S. Accessible countries can be frequently updated, refer to the dYdX [blog](https://dydx.exchange/blog#) for updates. \n\n## What Coins Are Supported on dYdX?\n\nThere are currently 33 active markets on the dYdX Chain, some of the most popular current markets are; Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche and Chainlink. View active markets [here](https://dydx.trade/#/markets).\n\n## How Much Are dYdX Chain Fees?\n\ndYdX Chain has a different fee structure to v3 of the platform. For a detailed understanding and analysis of the fee differences read this [blog](https://dydx.exchange/blog/v4-rewards-and-parameters) \n\n## Is It Possible To Leverage or Margin Trade on dYdX?\n\nAt the time of writing, traders can go long or short with 20X leverage on dYdX Chain active markets. \n\n## Migration of DYDX to the dYdX Chain\n\nOn June 22, 2022, dYdX Trading Inc.(\u201cdYdX Trading\u201d) announced the next iteration of the dYdX protocol - the dYdX Chain Open Source Software. The dYdX Chain is a proof-of-stake blockchain network and, as such, it requires a Layer 1 (\u201cL1\u201d) protocol token for staking to validators in order to secure the chain and for stakers of the L1 token to govern the network. \n\nThe [wethDYDX Smart Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x46b2deae6eff3011008ea27ea36b7c27255ddfa9) enables the migration of ethDYDX from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain. When interacted with, the wethDYDX Smart Contract would carry out the following functions in a fully permissionless and automated manner: Receive and permanently lock the ethDYDX tokens sent by the user to the wethDYDX Smart Contract; Send a wrapped version of the Ethereum-based DYDX token (\u201cwethDYDX\u201d) to the user on a 1-1 proportional basis on Ethereum; and dYdX Chain Validators can also read and ingest the information in the wethDYDX Smart Contract such that corresponding DYDX can be distributed to users by Validators on the dYdX Chain once there is confirmation that Step 1 above is complete and the ethDYDX is permanently locked in the wethDYDX Smart Contract. More information about the migration of ethDYDX from Ethereum to dYdX Chain is available [here](http://docs.dydx.community/dydx-token-migration/start-here/introduction).",

                "description": "## What Is Binance.US?\n\nBinance.US is the U.S. registered arm of the world\u2019s largest [cryptocurrency exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex) by [trading volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/trading-volume) \u2014 Binance. The separate exchange was launched in response to U.S. regulations restricting the main exchange. While Binance owns the Binance.US name and intellectual property, the exchange is managed independently by BAM Trading Services. Both exchanges differ in terms of deposit and withdrawal methods, [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) and trading fees.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. platform offers users fewer cryptocurrencies and trading pairs than the global site, with 120+ assets, while the main exchange lists about 600. The platform is not available in all 50 states of America.\n\n\n## Who Are the Binance.US Founders?\n\nThe exchange was launched in September 2019 and is managed independently by BAM Trading Services. The company's CEO is Brian Shroder, a former executive director of Ant Group Co. and Uber Technologies Inc.

                "description": "##What is BTSE?\n\nBTSE, which stands for \u201cBuy, Trade, Sell, Earn\u201d, is a trusted digital asset exchange that provides a secure and user-friendly platform for trading cryptocurrencies. As a top trusted crypto platform for institutions, retail users, and first-time traders, BTSE has developed multiple trading technologies that have set new standards for excellence and innovation in the world of digital asset trading. \n\nIts suite of financial services is designed to bridge traditional finance with digital asset solutions, featuring multi-currency spot and derivatives trading, NFT marketplace and exchange white-label solutions, OTC trading, asset management, payment gateways, and more. Additionally, BTSE prides itself on offering advanced features for futures trading, such as customizable leverage and perpetual contracts. With strict security protocols, an insurance fund, cold storage for more than 90% of assets, and no withdrawal limits on more than 12 fiat currencies and 150 cryptocurrencies, BTSE is at the forefront of the digital asset industry.\n\nBTSE licenses its industry-leading proprietary technology to exchanges worldwide through its white label exchange solutions.\n\n##Who are the BTSE founders?\n\nBTSE was founded in 2018 by Jonathan Leong with the mission of creating quality trading products for retail audiences. Leong is an established technology entrepreneur with more than 15 years of experience developing high performance, mission-critical systems. Wong has a decorated background, having served in several financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, and has built a successful high-speed trading product aimed at capturing inefficiencies in Asia financial markets.\n\nToday, BTSE is run by CEO Henry Liu and COO Jeff Mei, who each bring a diverse background in financial services to the table. Liu worked in merchant banking and started his career in blockchain in 2016. Mei leads global expansion and strategic operations, with experience in driving growth and development in both the blockchain and traditional finance industries. Together, Liu and Mei continue to uphold BTSE's commitment to providing a secure and user-friendly platform for trading cryptocurrencies and bridging traditional finance with digital asset solutions.\n\n##When did BTSE Launch?\n\nBTSE was launched in 2018 by a team specializing in high-frequency, low-latency, trading technology. The platform has since grown to be a crowd favorite about derivatives traders due to the advanced features offered.\n\n##Where is BTSE Located?\n\nBTSE is international - registered in the British Virgin Islands with offices in Taipei, Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. \n\n##BTSE Restricted Countries\n\nUnder BTSE\u2019s Terms and Conditions, restricted geographies include the United States, Iran and Syria. While users may be able to register for accounts, certain features will be unavailable without identity verification.\n\n##How Much Are BTSE Fees?\n\nOne of the stand-out features of BTSE is its highly competitive trading fees. For general users, trading fees for futures are 0.01% for maker orders and 0.05% for taker orders, while spot trading fees start at 0.20% for both maker and taker orders.\n\nHowever, for traders looking to take advantage of even lower fees, BTSE has implemented a 10-tier VIP program. This program rewards users with fee reductions based on their trading volume and BTSE token holdings. For example, the VIP program can reduce futures fees down to as low as -0.02% for maker orders and 0.036% for taker orders, while spot trading fees can be reduced to 0.02% for maker orders and 0.06% for taker orders.\n\nIn addition to the VIP program, all users can enjoy 0% maker fees on all markets by simply staking 100 BTSE tokens. The staking program has 8 tiers, and by staking the maximum of 20,000 BTSE tokens, maker fees become a rebate at -0.003%, which applies to both futures and spot trading. There are no volume requirements attached to the BTSE staking program.\n\nTo reward new sign-ups, BTSE also offers a 25% discount on trading fees for the first 30 days for users who have been referred.\n\n##Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trading on BTSE?\n\nBTSE offers leveraged futures trading on its platform, allowing traders to amplify their profits. Users can trade with up to 100x leverage on perpetual futures and up to 20x leverage on dated futures contracts.\n\nBTSE's multi-asset collateral and multi-asset settlement options allow for greater flexibility in futures trading. Traders can choose between cross and isolated futures wallets for better risk control. Additionally, sub-accounts are available to all users who require solid risk management and a range of order types including stop-loss, trailing stops, and take profit.\n\nThe platform also includes automated and customisable margin call notifications and advanced order types such as TWAP, OCO and algorithmic index orders \u2013 which also allows for hidden orders. Real-time streaming quotes provide traders with up-to-date market data to inform their decisions.",

                "description": "## What Is PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) is a popular [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) allowing [BEP-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) on the [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/). It is the biggest exchange of the [BNB Chain ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/bnb-chain/) and one of the top DEXs by market share. The exchange employs an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, allowing users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). You can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the exchange's trading fees.  \n\nLP token holders can also engage in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) to earn [CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/), the exchange's [utility token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/utility-token). The token can be [staked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) in so-called \u2018Syrup Pools\u2019 with flexible or fixed-term staking. Flexible staking allows users to unstake at any time, while fixed-term staking maximizes yield and locks up tokens for up to 52 weeks.\n\nFurthermore, PancakeSwap (V2) offers a lottery, where users can win prizes in CAKE. On the [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace, collectibles can be traded, and with the NFT Profile System, users can set up personalized profiles. There is also a [perpetual](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/perpetual-contracts) trading exchange, developed in partnership with ApolloX, that offers [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures) trading of several popular token pairs without an expiry date. Users can trade popular token pairs with leverage to enter a bigger position than their account balance. \n\n\n## Who Are the PancakeSwap (V2) Founders?\n\nThe PancakeSwap (V2) founders are anonymous and head a two-dozen strong team of anonymous \"Chefs\" working in the exchange's \"Kitchen.\" The exchange is open-source and has been [audited](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/audit) by reputable security firms like Certik and Slowmist. \n\n\n## When Did PancakeSwap (V2) Launch?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) launched in September 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is PancakeSwap (V2) Located?\n\nAs it is a decentralized exchange, the team works remotely. However, according to Crunchbase, PancakeSwap has its headquarters in Fukuoka, Japan.\n\n \n\n\n## PancakeSwap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nThere are no restricted countries or regions since the exchange is decentralized. However, the following countries and regions are geoblocked: Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Crimea, Syria, Sudan, Belarus and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n## PancakeSwap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAll BEP-20 tokens can be traded, as well as several popular futures pairs, such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, and all other big [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain).\n\n\n## How Much Are PancakeSwap (V2) Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.25% trading fee, with 0.17% returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward, 0.03% sent to the treasury and 0.05% sent towards a buyback and burn program. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nThe perpetual futures exchange allows leverage of up to 150X on the biggest trading pairs and 50X on smaller trading pairs.

                "description": "DoveSwap is an automated liquidity protocol powered by a constant product formula and implemented in a system of non-upgradeable smart contracts on the Polygon zkEVM blockchain. It obviates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritizing decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. \n\nEach DoveSwap smart contract, or pair, manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC-20 tokens. \n\nAnyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.\n\nPairs act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other as long as the \u201cconstant product\u201d formula is preserved. This formula, most simply expressed as x * y = k, states that trades must not change the product (k) of a pair\u2019s reserve balances (x and y). Because k remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.",

Ramses incentivizes liquidity by providing token lockers with the capability to direct protocol emissions towards token pairs of their choice. In return, lockers receive an anti-dilutive rebase, a portion of the swap fees generated by their selected pairs, and any bribes directed towards these pairs.\n\nveRAM token holders are motivated to vote for pools with the highest trading volumes because these high volume pools also generate the most fees. In addition, voters are motivated to vote for pools with bribes from protocols looking to bootstrap liquidity.\n\nLPs are incentivized with emissions that translate to real yield.\n\nTraders benefit from low slippage because of the liquidity provided, in accordance with proven vAMM / sAMM tech.\n\nProtocols can utilize a liquidity layer that is designed to promote collaboration. As a result, they can benefit from capital-efficient trading conditions for their tokens. Protocols also can incentivize liquidity by offering bribes to veRAM holders during periods of low trading activity.",

The exchange is operated by the Loopring team (which is distributed across China, Belgium, Canada, and the US). It supports the non-custodial trading of ETH and ERC20 tokens. Leveraging zkRollup tech, Loopring Exchange is capable of settling over 2,000 trades per second at a cost as low as $0.0001, without sacrificing 100% Ethereum security guarantees. It claims to be the most scalable DEX on Ethereum.\n\nLoopring is an open protocol for scalable non-custodial exchanges on Ethereum.

                "slug": "curve-finance",
                "description": "## What Is Curve Finance?\n\nCurve Finance is a [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized) [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) for [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) trading. Instead of an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book), it uses an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (automated market maker) model to match [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity). As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, anyone can [provide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) liquidity to one or more of the [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). The constant product formula of the AMM ensures maximum efficiency while incurring a minimum of [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) for traders. \n\nThe Curve pools are [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) implementing the StableSwap invariant and enabling the exchange of two or more tokens. Token [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) can be performed between paired stablecoins (Plain Pools) or between [wrapped](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) tokens, with the underlying collateral lent out on another protocol (Lending Pools). Finally, Metapools pair stablecoins against LP-tokens from another pool.\n\nThe protocol is available multi-chain \u2014 on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem), [Aurora](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aurora-near/), [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), [Fantom](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/), [Harmony](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harmony/), [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-optimism-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-optimism-ecosystem), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), [xDai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xdai/) and [Moonbeam](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moonbeam/). Users typically have to [bridge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges) funds from Ethereum to these chains to use the Curve protocol. Due to its systemic importance for [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi), the protocol has attracted several other protocols fighting over its [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) in the so-called [Curve Wars](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/curve-wars-and-the-emergency-dao). \n\n\n## Who Is the Curve Finance Founder?\n\nCurve Finance was founded by Michael Egorov, the former co-founder and CTO of NuCypher, a cryptocurrency infrastructure protocol. He also founded LoanCoin, a decentralized bank and loans network. Before his work in the cryptocurrency industry, Egorov studied at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and the Swinburne University of Technology. \n\n\n## When Did Curve Finance Launch?\n\nCurve Finance was launched in June 2020, amidst the so-called DeFi Summer, and is considered one of the core building blocks of the nascent [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) sector.\n\n\n## Where Is Curve Finance Located?\n\nAccording to CBInsights, Curve Finance has its headquarters in Switzerland.  \n\n \n\n\n## Curve Finance Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about possible restricted countries. However, users from countries under US financial sanctions may be subject to geoblocking. \n\n\n## Curve Finance Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange supports liquidity pools for major stablecoins like [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/), [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [FRAX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/frax/) and [TUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/). It also offers swaps between wrapped tokens like [wBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [stETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steth/) (a derivative of staked Ether native to [Lido](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lido-dao/)). \n\n\n## How Much Are Curve Finance Fees?\n\nAccording to the protocol, the standard fee on all pools is 0.04%. Half of the fee goes to liquidity providers, the other half to veCRV holders. veCRV holders receive enhanced governance rights in return for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) their tokens for fixed periods of time. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Curve Finance?\n\nThis exchange offers only token swaps and thus does not have leverage or margin trading.

                "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) which first introduced the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. Unlike with an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book), traders are provided with constant liquidity thanks to the \u201cconstant product\u201d formula. The V2 version was first based on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), before branching out to other blockchains that support [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens.\n\nWhile the V1 version of Uniswap only supported [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) ETH-ERC-20 token pairs, the V2 version did away with this bridging problem and introduced flash swaps. These allowed users to swap between different ERC-20 tokens without incurring too much [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage). It also introduced protocol fees, which contributed to the platform's ongoing development. Furthermore, the V2 version began using [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) over native Ether for its core contracts. \n\nThe exchange\u2019s popularity gave birth to a V3 version with concentrated liquidity and more flexible fees, which improved the user experience for traders and liquidity providers alike. \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V2)?\n\nHayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate, founded the platform in November 2018. The company behind the DEX raised a seed round from Paradigm and $11 million in a Series A round led by \u200b\u200bAndreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V2) Launch?\n\nUniswap\u2019s V1 version was a proof-of-concept first launched in November 2018, and later improved with the introduction of the V2 version in August 2020. The V3 version in May 2021 marks the current final iteration of the exchange.\n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap (V2) Located?\n\nUniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized exchange, is headquartered in New York City. \n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nAs of July 2022, Uniswap has banned users from 10 countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. government, including Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAs a permissionless decentralized exchange, tokens can be freely listed by anyone providing liquidity to trade them. The most liquid tokens at the time of writing include stablecoins and wrapped tokens like [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n\n## How Much Are Uniswap (V2) Fees?\n\nThe exchange\u2019s V2 version charges 0.3% per token swap. 0.05% goes to the protocol and 0.25% is allocated to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens).\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap V2 does not offer leverage or margin trading.",

                "description": "## What Is SushiSwap?\n\nSushiSwap is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) that uses an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm). This automated market maker utilizes [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to create markets for trading pairs of different tokens. [Liquidity providers ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens)supply these smart contracts with capital and enable frictionless trading. The exchange was one of the earliest to adopt this model and was initially a [fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fork-software) of UniSwap, another popular DEX. It later grew into one of the biggest exchanges in all of [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) and is now available on almost all [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) and several [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions for [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). \n\nThe exchange targets mostly DeFi traders and institutions that want to enjoy [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) and [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) trading. It does away with liquidity issues and has a more egalitarian [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) approach than other exchanges. Its native token can be used for voting on governance proposals.        \n\nIts core products include the Bento Box, a token vault that generates yield for the capital deposited into it. Kashi lending is a lending and [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading) platform where anyone can create customized and gas-efficient markets for tokens. MasterChef V2 is a liquidity provision program that contains over $1 billion, at the time of writing. Finally, Miso provides projects with access to trading on the exchange itself, either through fixed price or dutch auction options. \n\n\n## Who Are the SushiSwap Founders?\n\nSushiSwap was originally founded by Chef Nomi ([pseudonym](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/pseudonymous)). They later left the project and handed off its management to two other pseudonymous developers called sushiswap and 0xMaki. They developed the product and the business, before the ownership of the exchange was passed on to Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, a [centralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex). \n\n\n## When Did SushiSwap Launch?\n\nSushiSwap launched in August 2020. \n\n\n## Where Is SushiSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange does not have a central headquarter but operates in a decentralized manner instead.\n\n \n## SushiSwap Restricted Countries\n\nThere is no information about possibly blocked or restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n\n## SushiSwap Supported Coins List \n\nSushiSwap supports almost all [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens on the market, thanks to its presence on several layer-one and layer-two blockchains.\n\n\n## How Much Are SushiSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges the industry standard of 0.3% for token swaps.\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on SushiSwap?\n\nSushiswap offers Kashi, a lending and margin trading platform that uses a unique [isolated market](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/isolated-margin) framework.",

They deposit them into the pool, receiving liquidity provider (or LP) tokens in return. They can use those tokens to reclaim their share, plus a portion of the trading fees. \n\nThe LP tokens are called FLIP tokens. PancakeSwap also allows users to farm additional tokens \u2013 CAKE and SYRUP. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens, locking them up in a process that rewards users with CAKE.  Users can stake CAKE tokens to receive SYRUP, which will have further functionality as governance tokens (and as tickets in a lotteries).",

                "description": "## What Is Dodo (Ethereum)?\n\nDodo is an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)-based [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) with a \u201cproactive market maker,\u201d a customized version of an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)). Dodo provides a way to issue and trade digital assets on the blockchain. It provides both its own and aggregated liquidity from other exchanges, which, according to its whitepaper, allows the exchange to offer the best prices for Web3 assets anywhere. \n\nUsers can [swap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) different tokens in a permissionless manner, either through [market orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-order-market-buy-market-sell) or [limit orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/limit-order). Dodo also offers gasless swap routes, which use professional market makers for deeper liquidity with zero slippage and gas fees. Furthermore, an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) market enables the trading of [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) and [ERC-1155](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-1155) tokens. The [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) program is one of the ways to earn on the exchange, and users can add liquidity to receive LP tokens and earn a share of the trading fees. Another way is mining, where users engage either in single coin mining or LP market-making mining by adding funds to designated [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). There is also the option to borrow flash loans and deploy capital in a more efficient way.\n\nFinally, the exchange offers developers a tool to create tokens. Several blockchains like Ethereum, [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/) and OKChain are supported.  \n\n\n## Who Are the Dodo Founders?\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, Dodo was founded by Qi Wang and Shichao Dai, two Chinese nationals. The DEX raised a total of $5 million from 17 different ventures, including Coinbase Ventures, Defiance Capital and Galaxy Digital.     \n\n\n## When Did Dodo Launch?\n\nDodo launched in August 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is Dodo Located?\n\nCrunchbase lists Hong Kong as the exchange\u2019s headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## Dodo Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## Dodo Supported Coins List \n\nDodo has deployed on almost all [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible blockchains like [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem), [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-optimism-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-optimism-ecosystem), [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) and [Aurora](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aurora-near/). It thus supports a plethora of different tokens across all blockchains, including all major tokens, as well as [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) and [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin). \n\n\n## How Much Are Dodo Fees?\n\nDodo charges a small usage fee for creating new tokens (0.02 ETH) but does not provide any information about trading fees. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Dodo?\n\nThere is currently no option to margin trade, but the roadmap promises to introduce leverage trading in 2022.

                "description": "## What Is Honeyswap?\n\nHoneyswap is a replicated deployment of [UniSwap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) on the [xDai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xdaistable/) chain. xDai is an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [side chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain) with the same properties as Ethereum but a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism). That allows validators to verify blocks every five seconds, minimizing transaction fees in the process. UniSwap is the most popular [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) on Ethereum, and pioneered the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model .\n\nThe exchange is governed by the 1hive community, using the [HNY](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/honey-hive-investments/) token. It functions as an automated liquidity protocol with a constant product formula. As is the case for UniSwap, anyone can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) by depositing tokens in the [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) and receiving LP tokens in return. Traders can [swap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) tokens and developers can build integrations with the [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), using them as so-called \u201cmoney legos.\u201d \n\nThe community is divided into different \u201cswarms,\u201d which build around different project initiatives. The [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) itself enables [flash loans](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/flash-loan), [oracles](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/oracles) and token swaps. To use the exchange, users have to [bridge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges) their ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to xDai. \n\n\n## Who Are the Honeyswap Founders?\n\nHoneyswap is governed by a [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) in a decentralized and censorship-resistant manner. The [Honey token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/honey-hive-investments/) is used to vote on [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) proposals. The 1Hive protocol, which is the foundation of the decentralized exchange, is based on software built by Aragon. Aragon provides open-source infrastructure to DAOs and was founded by the Aragon Association, a Switzerland-based non-profit entity.\n\n\n## When Did Honeyswap Launch?\n\nHoneyswap launched in September 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is Honeyswap Located?\n\nSince the DEX is governed by a DAO, it has no central location but is managed in a decentralized fashion. \n\n \n\n\n## Honeyswap Restricted Countries\n\nThere are no formal restrictions on a decentralized exchange like Honeyswap. However, users from countries sanctioned by the US government can be sanctioned. These include Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Crimea, Syria, Sudan, Belarus and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n## Honeyswap Supported Coins List \n\nAs a fork of UniSwap (V2), [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens are supported. \n\n\n## How Much Are Honeyswap Fees?\n\nHoneyswap charges a 0.3% fee for token swaps. 0.25% is redistributed to liquidity providers proportional to their stake in the liquidity pool and 0.05% is a protocol fee going to the exchange itself.  \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Honeyswap?\n\nThere is no leverage or margin trading on this exchange.

                "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) which first introduced the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. Unlike with an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book), traders are provided with constant liquidity thanks to the \u201cconstant product\u201d formula. The V2 version was first based on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), before branching out to other blockchains that support [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens.\n\nWhile the V1 version of Uniswap only supported [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) ETH-ERC-20 token pairs, the V2 version did away with this bridging problem and introduced flash swaps. These allowed users to swap between different ERC-20 tokens without incurring too much [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage). It also introduced protocol fees, which contributed to the platform's ongoing development. Furthermore, the V2 version began using [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) over native Ether for its core contracts. \n\nThe exchange\u2019s popularity gave birth to a V3 version with concentrated liquidity and more flexible fees, which improved the user experience for traders and liquidity providers alike. \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V2)?\n\nHayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate, founded the platform in November 2018. The company behind the DEX raised a seed round from Paradigm and $11 million in a Series A round led by \u200b\u200bAndreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V2) Launch?\n\nUniswap\u2019s V1 version was a proof-of-concept first launched in November 2018, and later improved with the introduction of the V2 version in August 2020. The V3 version in May 2021 marks the current final iteration of the exchange.\n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap (V2) Located?\n\nUniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized exchange, is headquartered in New York City. \n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nAs of July 2022, Uniswap has banned users from 10 countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. government, including Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n## Uniswap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAs a permissionless decentralized exchange, tokens can be freely listed by anyone providing liquidity to trade them. The most liquid tokens at the time of writing include stablecoins and wrapped tokens like [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n\n## How Much Are Uniswap (V2) Fees?\n\nThe exchange\u2019s V2 version charges 0.3% per token swap. 0.05% goes to the protocol and 0.25% is allocated to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens).\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Uniswap (V2)?\n\nUniswap V2 does not offer leverage or margin trading.",

                "description": "## What Is KLAYswap?\n\n[Klayswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klayswap-protocol/) is a complete on-chain instant swap protocol. It offers an on-chain [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) powered by an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)). Its main value proposition is offering anyone with a KCT-type token to become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) and earn income from transaction fee commissions. The exchange enables [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) from [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) to the Klaytn ecosystem via its Orbit Bridge, an IBC bridge built on the Orbit chain, which is a part of the [Cosmos](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/) ecosystem. \n\nIn KLAYswap, Ethereum-based tokens (ETH, ORC, DAI, WBTC) can be transferred to the Klaytn ecosystem via Orbit Bridge, a transparent IBC bridge, built on Orbit Chain, to offer yield farming with asset pairings previously unconnected in the decentralized world\n\nUsers can provide liquidity by matching KLAY-KCT pairs with the token contracts created in the exchange\u2019s pool menu. With the LP tokens, they receive a share of the trading fees generated by the token pair. Any token listed in the protocol is available for trading. The price depends on the number of pairs of the respective tokens. \n\nFurthermore, the [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) allows users to participate in improvement proposals and to pay for a KCT token pool contract creation fee. Tokens can be acquired through a process called [liquidity mining](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-mining). \n\nVarious people can participate in the KLAYswap ecosystem, including long-term investors who want to hold cryptocurrency for a long time, investors who want to earn income through commission fees, and miners who want to take part in governance through KSP mining. Token holders can influence the governance of the DEX and vote on fees, mining distributions, and deploying new [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). The token can also be used to pay the pool creation fee for founding a new liquidity pool on the exchange.\n\n\n## Who Are the KLAYswap Founders?\n\nAs a trustless on-chain swap protocol, Klayswap has no founder or CEO leading the exchange. Instead, anyone that wants to participate in the decentralized and trustless swapping of tokens between KCT tokens and other standards can participate in its [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance). \n\n\n## When Did KLAYswap Launch?\n\nKlayswap launched in January 2021.\n\n\n## Where Is KLAYswap Located?\n\nThere is no headquarter since the exchange works in a decentralized way. \n\n \n\n\n## KLAYswap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## KLAYswap Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange supports all tokens that adhere to the KCT token standard, such as [KSP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klayswap-protocol/) and [KLAY](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klaytn/).\n\n\n## How Much Are KLAYswap Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur an industry-standard 0.3% fee both for makers and  takers. Fees can be changed by community governance.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on KLAYswap?\n\nKlayswap does not offer [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage) or [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading).\n\n##Who participates in KLAYswap? \n\nKLAyswap participants include liquidity providers and traders.  You can provide liquidity by matching KLAY-KCT pairs with the token contracts created in KLAYswap\u2019s Pool Menu. If providing liquidity, you will receive a Liquidity Provider (LP) token as a supply certificate. You will receive a reward share of the fees from that respective pool as a contribution reward. Tokens listed in the protocol can be traded with KLAY or KCT within the scope of the respective pool. The transaction price is based on the existent number of pairs of the respective tokens.\n\nKLAYswap, as a trustless on-chain swap protocol, is a service created by all participants (liquidity providers, traders, and community members) and not by a particular operator. With this and the decentralized, trustless philosophy of blockchain in mind, KLAYswap issued the KSP (KLAYswap Protocol) governance token so participants can create KLAYswap\u2019s policies and direction and lead to the gradual, continued development of the service.\n\n##Yield Farming on KLAYswap and getting the KSP token\n\nWith the KSP governance token, KLAYswap is officially owned by all participants and allows participants to obtain their own continuity of service. KLAYswap, valuing the principle of neutrality and trustlessness, limits the role of KSP to contributing to the development of protocols and the development of service ecosystems so that the protocol\u2019s governance can be strictly observed. KSP has the main utilities of governance voting and paying for a KCT token pool contract creation fee. \n\nIn KLAYswap, a complete on-chain instant swap protocol, traders can not only experience immediate transactions via liquidity pools, but also develop services by deciding the policy and direction of KLAYswap with the KSP governance token.\n\nIn addition, users can receive various forms of compensation, including transaction fee revenue, for contributing to the growth of the protocol. Various people can participate in the KLAYswap ecosystem, including long-term investors who want to hold cryptocurrency for a long time, investors who want to earn income through commission fees, and miners who want to participate in KLAYswap governance through KSP mining.",

                "description": "Venus is an algorithmic-based money market system designed to bring a complete decentralized finance-based lending and credit system onto Binance Smart Chain. Venus enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies by supplying collateral to the network that may be borrowed by pledging over-collateralized cryptocurrencies. This creates a secure lending environment where the lender receives a compounded interest rate annually (APY) paid per block, while the borrower pays interest on the cryptocurrency borrowed. These interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, where the rates are automated based on the demand of the specific market, such as Bitcoin. The difference of Venus from other money market protocols is the ability to use the collateral supplied to the market not only to borrow other assets but also to mint synthetic stablecoins with over-collateralized positions that protect the protocol. These synthetic stablecoins are not backed by a basket of fiat currencies but by a basket of cryptocurrencies. Venus utilizes the Binance Smart chain for fast, low-cost transactions while accessing a deep network of wrapped tokens and liquidity.",

More trading pools and pairs to be launched soon\r\n\r\nYields for providing liquidity are presently over 300+ % APY. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn DeFiChain, DeFi transactions (incl yield farming and swaps), are actual native consensus transactions, validated by all nodes and miners. Compared to other projects where transactions are done as machine instructions, moving bits and bytes.\r\nBy being a first layer protocol, DeFiChain provides stronger security and reliability for DeFi transactions.\r\nFurthermore, DeFiChain also anchors and leverages on the Bitcoin blockchain for increased security.\r\n\r\nAs a unique feature of DeFiChain DEX, no fees are required to withdraw farming yields. These rewards are automatically credited to a user\u2019s address every block (average 30+ sec). This allows users of all sizes to participate profitably in yield farming.\r\n\r\nDeFiChain and DeFiChain DEX have been audited and passed by SlowMist and KnownSec with no vulnerabilities found.\r\n\r\nTo participate and earn high yields, download the app here: https://defichain.com/dex/\r\n\r\nFor help and support join the DeFiChain Telegram channel at: https://t.me/defiblockchain",

                "description": "## What Is Blockchain.com?\n\nBlockchain.com is one of the early pioneers of key infrastructure for the Bitcoin community. It is associated with various projects: Blockchain Explorer that allows anyone to examine transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, a robust API for companies that wish to build on Bitcoin, and its popular crypto wallet. Since its launch in 2011, the company has transacted over $1 trillion in crypto.\n\nInterestingly, about one-third of all Bitcoin network transactions are via Blockchain.com. As of October 2022, the company had about 37 million verified users who created more than 80 million wallets.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Blockchain.com?\n\nFormerly known as Blockchain.info, the cryptocurrency financial services company began its operations as a Bitcoin blockchain explorer. It was founded in August 2011. Benjamin Reeves_, _Nicolas Cary, and Peter Smith were among the people who developed its core projects.\n\nPrior to creating the website for tracking Bitcoin transactions, Reeves obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration, Management, and Operations at Newcastle-upon-Tyne University in 2009. He went on to achieve a first-class Master\u2019s degree in Computer Science and became a mobile developer at Engine Room Apps in 2010. He was also the CEO of Qkos Services Ltd, a software development company that dissolved in 2014.\n\nAs for Cary, he studied Business at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, between 2003 and 2007 before working as a partner and manager of customer operations at PipelineDeals until 2013. Meanwhile, Smith obtained a degree from the University of London and has been part of the UK Finance board.\u00a0\n\n\n## When Did Blockchain.com Launch?\n\nBitcoin blockchain explorer launched in August 2011. But it wasn\u2019t until July 2019 that the firm launched its cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\n## Where Is Blockchain.com Located?\n\nBlockchain.com has its primary headquarters in London, with other branches in Lithuania and United States. \n\n\n## Blockchain.com Restricted Countries\n\nAlthough the crypto exchange supports many countries across the globe, there are a few restricted regions due to international and local financial/cryptocurrency regulations. People residing in Afghanistan, Barbados, Belarus, Burundi, Cambodia, the United States, and 28 other regions can not use its services.\n\n\n## What Coins Are Supported on Blockchain.com?\n\nAs of 2022, a list of the company\u2019s support page showed that the exchange offers 31 digital assets.\n\n\n## How Much Are Blockchain.com Fees?\n\nBlockchain.com offers a tiered fee structure based on a 30-day trading volume. Maker fees range from 0% to 0.20%, and taker fees are between 0.06% and 0.40%.\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Blockchain.com?\n\nThe platform supports 5X margin trading on a few USD and USDT pairs for verified users in particular jurisdictions. It is not available in the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy and countries on the sanctions list.",

                "description": "## What Is OpenOcean?\n\n[OpenOcean](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/openocean/) is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) aggregator. It sources liquidity from different [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) markets and facilitates [cross-chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cross-chain) swaps. Thanks to its routing algorithm, the aggregator finds the most attractive prices from various exchanges and provides traders with low [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) and fast [settlement](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/settlement). Since the aggregator is free of charge, users only pay the gas and exchange fees on the respective blockchains, though nothing to OpenOcean itself.\n\nThe protocol collects data from major decentralized and [centralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex). It also sources liquidity from [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions like [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem) and [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-optimism-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-optimism-ecosystem), as well as other blockchains like [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/), and others. The protocol continues expanding to other chains to meet the needs of its community. Users can place [limit orders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/limit-order) and engage in [liquidity providing](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens).\n\nMoreover, it aggregates [derivative](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/derivative) products and aims to release its wealth management services. An API and [arbitrage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/arbitrage) tools serve for automated trading strategies. The exchange\u2019s vision is to build a crypto-only trading aggregator with increased capital efficiency, connecting the currently fragmented DeFi and CeFi markets. This shall allow each investor (despite their size or affiliation) to trade at the best prices and apply their investment strategies across the cryptocurrency markets. A future SaaS tool will provide automated arbitrage strategies and grid trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges to achieve that goal.\n\n\n## Who Are the OpenOcean Founders?\n\nThe OpenOcean founders are anonymous and work according to the decentralized ethos of the exchange, which is open-source and has been [audited](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/audit) by security firms like Certik.\n\n\n## When Did OpenOcean Launch?\n\nOpenOcean launched in July 2021.\n\n\n## Where Is OpenOcean Located?\n\nWith no centralized leadership heading the project, there is no headquarter or central location from where the exchange operates. \n\n\n## OpenOcean Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n\n## OpenOcean Supported Coins List \n\nOpenOcean has integrated more than 16 blockchains and includes [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible and non-EVM-compatible chains. It thus supports almost all relevant cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n## How Much Are OpenOcean Fees?\n\nThere are no fees on this exchange. Users only have to pay the gas fees and exchange fees from the different platforms used by the aggregator. For token swaps through the liquidity pools, a flat 0.2% fee is charged, with 0.15% going to liquidity providers and 0.05% to the treasury.\n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on OpenOcean?\n\nOpenOcean does not offer [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage) or [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading).",

Its transaction mining and liquidity mining launched on the same day. In September 2021, it rolled out its DAO governance feature. On October 8, 2021, the DEX became available on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### Where Is MDEX Located?\n\nThe company has its primary headquarters in Singapore.\n\n### MDEX Restricted Countries\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, it has restricted IP access from Canada, Singapore, China (including Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan), and North Korea.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on MDEX?\n\nThe exchange platform currently lists 55 cryptocurrencies, with zero fiat currencies and trading pairs.\n\n### How Much Are MDEX Fees?\n\nMDEX charges a 0.3% transaction fee on all trades. \n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on MDEX?\n\nThe DEX does not support margin trading on spot markets. However, in October 2022, it launched a USDT-margined perpetual trading feature in collaboration with the on-chain derivatives platform ApolloX Finance.",

Its [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) integrates upgradeable [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and renders [intermediaries](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/intermediary-middleman) obsolete. The exchange is based on open-source software and prioritizes decentralization, [censorship resistance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/censorship-resistance) and security. It benefits from ultra-low gas prices compared to Ethereum, as well as fast and simple trading execution.    \n\nAnyone can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) by depositing two tokens into a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). The exchange enables the trading of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens, which are traded according to the constant product formula. The mechanism removes the need for an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) and allows traders to tap into a constant pool of liquidity. \n\nLiquidity providers can passively invest their assets to accumulate trading fees or provide liquidity as a hedge for certain trading strategies. Traders use tools like [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) or can deploy arbitrage bots to compare prices across different exchanges. Finally, developers integrate the exchange with different liquidity aggregators or [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hot-wallet).\n\n\n## Who Are the QuickSwap Founders?\n\nQuickSwap was founded by Roc Zacharias, who is also the CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a blockchain marketing and consultancy firm that also acts as an advisor to the exchange. It is furthermore advised by the Matic Foundation, a governing body of the Polygon blockchain. \n\n\n## When Did QuickSwap Launch?\n\nQuickSwap launched in May 2021 with over 96% of the tokens distributed to the community. It is now considered the main decentralized exchange for Polygon, a [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solution for Ethereum. \n\n\n## Where Is QuickSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange doesn\u2019t provide any information about its headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## QuickSwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## QuickSwap Supported Coins List \n\nQuickSwap supports all ERC-20 tokens deployed on Polygon, including wrapped tokens like [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin). \n\n\n## How Much Are QuickSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges a 0.3% fee for swapping tokens, which is distributed among liquidity providers on a pro-rata basis. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on QuickSwap?\n\nThere is no margin or [leverage trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-leverage-in-crypto-trading-and-how-to-use-it) option on this exchange.

                "description": "## What Is Raydium?\n\n[Raydium](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/raydium/) is a [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)-based [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) with an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. Users can [swap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap), trade, and become [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens). The exchange provides liquidity to [Serum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serum/), another Solana-based exchange with a central [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) model. Therefore, Raydium users can access the order flow and liquidity of Serum and vice versa. Furthermore, the platform claims to offer the best price swap feature that automatically determines whether a token swap is cheaper if routed through the [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) or the Serum order book. \n\nUsers can also add liquidity and receive LP tokens, which represent a proportional share of the pooled assets. Every time a token swap is performed, LP token holders receive 0.22% of the trade volume. It is distributed according to the proportion of liquidity provided to the pool. There is also an option to create permissionless pools, which will also place orders on the Serum order book. This way, users can add any token pairs they wish and earn a share of the trading fees. \n\nThe native [RAY](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/raydium/) token can be staked to earn additional tokens. It also serves as a [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) that can be used to vote on improvement proposals and fee structures on the exchange.  \n\n\n## Who Are the Raydium Founders?\n\nAlphaRay leads overall strategy, operations, product direction and business development for Raydium. With a background in algorithmic trading in commodities, Alpha transitioned to market making and liquidity providing for cryptocurrency in 2017 and hasn't looked back. After diving into DeFi in the summer of 2020, Alpha saw a market need for an order book AMM to aggregate liquidity, and with the release of Serum, pulled together a team of experienced trading developers to tackle the problem head on.\nXRay is Raydium's Chief of Technology and Dev Team leader. X has 8 years of experience as a trading and low latency systems architect for both traditional and crypto markets.

                "description": "## What Is PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) is a popular [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) allowing [BEP-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) on the [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/). It is the biggest exchange of the [BNB Chain ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/bnb-chain/) and one of the top DEXs by market share. The exchange employs an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, allowing users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). You can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the exchange's trading fees.  \n\nLP token holders can also engage in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) to earn [CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/), the exchange's [utility token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/utility-token). The token can be [staked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) in so-called \u2018Syrup Pools\u2019 with flexible or fixed-term staking. Flexible staking allows users to unstake at any time, while fixed-term staking maximizes yield and locks up tokens for up to 52 weeks.\n\nFurthermore, PancakeSwap (V2) offers a lottery, where users can win prizes in CAKE. On the [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace, collectibles can be traded, and with the NFT Profile System, users can set up personalized profiles. There is also a [perpetual](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/perpetual-contracts) trading exchange, developed in partnership with ApolloX, that offers [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures) trading of several popular token pairs without an expiry date. Users can trade popular token pairs with leverage to enter a bigger position than their account balance. \n\n\n## Who Are the PancakeSwap (V2) Founders?\n\nThe PancakeSwap (V2) founders are anonymous and head a two-dozen strong team of anonymous \"Chefs\" working in the exchange's \"Kitchen.\" The exchange is open-source and has been [audited](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/audit) by reputable security firms like Certik and Slowmist. \n\n\n## When Did PancakeSwap (V2) Launch?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) launched in September 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is PancakeSwap (V2) Located?\n\nAs it is a decentralized exchange, the team works remotely. However, according to Crunchbase, PancakeSwap has its headquarters in Fukuoka, Japan.\n\n \n\n\n## PancakeSwap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nThere are no restricted countries or regions since the exchange is decentralized. However, the following countries and regions are geoblocked: Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Crimea, Syria, Sudan, Belarus and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n## PancakeSwap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAll BEP-20 tokens can be traded, as well as several popular futures pairs, such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, and all other big [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain).\n\n\n## How Much Are PancakeSwap (V2) Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.25% trading fee, with 0.17% returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward, 0.03% sent to the treasury and 0.05% sent towards a buyback and burn program. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nThe perpetual futures exchange allows leverage of up to 150X on the biggest trading pairs and 50X on smaller trading pairs.

                "description": "## What Is Uniswap?\n\nUniswap is one of the most popular cryptocurrency [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEXs), launching in November 2018. It pioneered the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, instead of the traditional order book-based used by exchanges. Uniswap runs on the Ethereum blockchain and uses a number of [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to securely swap [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens between users.\n\nThe decentralized aspect of the protocol means that there is no single centralized authority that manages and runs the exchange \u2014 instead, swaps are done in a [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) (P2P) manner. Moreover, Uniswap strives to solve the [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) problem inherent in other exchanges. Uniswap V3 is the 3rd edition of the protocol fitted with updates to improve compensation and provide greater control and flexibility for individual LPs. Uniswap V3 supports over 46.5% of the total DEX trading volume and the protocol reached a cumulative lifetime trading volume of $1 trillion in May 2022.\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap V3\n\nUniswap was founded by Hayden Adams, a graduate of Stony Brook University and a former mechanical engineer at Siemens. Inspired by a blog and Reddit post by Vitalik Buterin, Adams received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation and launched the protocol in November 2018. Uniswap Labs raised a seed round from Paradigm and, in August 2020, received $11 million in its Series A round led by \u200b\u200bAndreessen Horowitz.\n\nUniswap V3 launched in May of 2021, almost 2.5 years after the first version was released, and a year after Uniswap V2 was launched. \n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap Located?\n\nThe Uniswap protocol and Uniswap interface were developed by Uniswap Labs, which is located in New York City. As a[ decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) protocol, it can be used worldwide by anyone with internet access. However, there are some restrictions depending on what country you are from. As of July 2022, Uniswap has banned 10 countries from its protocol. The list of countries includes Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, C\u00f4te D'ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n## What Coins Can Be Traded on Uniswap?\n\nAs a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol, anyone can list a token on Uniswap. The most popular trading pairs at the time of writing include [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n## How Much Are Uniswap V3 Fees?\n\nUniswap V3 liquidity providers can initially create liquidity pools at three fee levels: 0.05%, 0.30% and 1%. More fee levels may be added through the UNI governance proposal. \n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Uniswap?\n\nUniswap V3 does not offer leverage or margin trading directly on its platform.",

Liquidity Pools work similar to how pools work on DEX platforms such as Pancakeswap and Uniswap. The difference with Xeggex is that any assets we have listed can be paired together without having to wrap any assets to another blockchain. Also, since the add and remove liquidity functions do not require an on chain transaction fee, the cost of these actions are zero.  Xeggex also offers some of the industries lowest withdraw fee rates, which are based on actual network cost and are not designed for profit. Xeggex supports many different types of blockchains and tokenized assets and we continues to add more every week.",

                "description": "## What Is ViperSwap?\r\n\r\nViperSwap is an automated market maker (AMM), a decentralized exchange (DEX) and DeFi protocol that allows users to exchange tokens, provide liquidity and earn trading fees.\r\n\r\nThe DEX launched March 8th, 2021 and runs on Harmony's blockchain - making it one of the fastest and cheapest DEX:es in existence.\r\n\r\nViperSwap is based on a mashup of Uniswap and SushiSwap smart contracts and features an automated market maker model where users trade against liquidity pools.\r\n\r\nThe pool liquidity is deposited by users who want to earn trading fees as well as staking rewards for providing the liquidity. After depositing funds the users earn a liquidity provider (LP) token called VENOM-LP which can be staked to earn additional rewards besides trading fees.\r\n\r\nThe LP token is also used by users to reclaim their initial provided capital plus earned trading fees.\r\n\r\n## What Makes ViperSwap Unique?\r\n\r\nViperSwap takes advantage of Harmony's 2-second finality and extremely low transaction fees to offer one of the fastest and cheapest DEX:es in existence right now.\r\n\r\nA regular swap transaction on ViperSwap typically costs around $0.0000000015 - making the platform a viable option for everyone since users don't have to pay $10, $20 or even $100 to perform a single swap.\r\n\r\nViperSwap is governed by the VIPER governance token which is HRC-20 token awarded to liquidity providers staking their LP tokens on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe VIPER token features a unique lockup system designed to incentivize long-term protocol participation with the explicit goal of rewarding early and loyal liquidity providers. The token is used for both protocol governance as well as incentivizing liquidity providers.\r\n\r\nSwaps on ViperSwap follow a similar fee model as Uniswap and Sushiswap: every trade carries a 0.3% fee.\r\n\r\nViperSwap features a fee-sharing system called the \"ViperPit\" where 0.1% of the 0.3% fee (1/3rd) is distributed to users staking the VIPER token in the ViperPit single-asset staking pool. This is 50% more than what is awarded to stakers in e.g. SushiSwap (which rewards stakers with 1/6th of trading fees).\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n\r\n* Super fast DEX\r\n* Insanely low swap fees (as low as $0.0000000015!)\r\n* Attractive fee sharing mechanism rewarding singe-asset stakers 1/3rd of all generated trading fees",

                "description": "## What Is Uniswap?\n\nUniswap is one of the most popular cryptocurrency [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEXs), launching in November 2018. It pioneered the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, instead of the traditional order book-based used by exchanges. Uniswap runs on the Ethereum blockchain and uses a number of [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to securely swap [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens between users.\n\nThe decentralized aspect of the protocol means that there is no single centralized authority that manages and runs the exchange \u2014 instead, swaps are done in a [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) (P2P) manner. Moreover, Uniswap strives to solve the [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) problem inherent in other exchanges. Uniswap V3 is the 3rd edition of the protocol fitted with updates to improve compensation and provide greater control and flexibility for individual LPs. Uniswap V3 supports over 46.5% of the total DEX trading volume and the protocol reached a cumulative lifetime trading volume of $1 trillion in May 2022.\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap V3\n\nUniswap was founded by Hayden Adams, a graduate of Stony Brook University and a former mechanical engineer at Siemens. Inspired by a blog and Reddit post by Vitalik Buterin, Adams received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation and launched the protocol in November 2018. Uniswap Labs raised a seed round from Paradigm and, in August 2020, received $11 million in its Series A round led by \u200b\u200bAndreessen Horowitz.\n\nUniswap V3 launched in May of 2021, almost 2.5 years after the first version was released, and a year after Uniswap V2 was launched. \n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap Located?\n\nThe Uniswap protocol and Uniswap interface were developed by Uniswap Labs, which is located in New York City. As a[ decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) protocol, it can be used worldwide by anyone with internet access. However, there are some restrictions depending on what country you are from. As of July 2022, Uniswap has banned 10 countries from its protocol. The list of countries includes Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, C\u00f4te D'ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n## What Coins Can Be Traded on Uniswap?\n\nAs a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol, anyone can list a token on Uniswap. The most popular trading pairs at the time of writing include [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n## How Much Are Uniswap V3 Fees?\n\nUniswap V3 liquidity providers can initially create liquidity pools at three fee levels: 0.05%, 0.30% and 1%. More fee levels may be added through the UNI governance proposal. \n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Uniswap?\n\nUniswap V3 does not offer leverage or margin trading directly on its platform.",

                "description": "SpiritSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Fantom Opera Chain that launched April 25, 2021. SpiritSwap is a constant-product automated market maker (AMM). In an AMM, users can simply provide liquidity by depositing a token pair into a pool. In return,. they receive LP tokens to track their share of the pool and they earn a fee for every swap that occurs in their pool. User's can trade against a liquidity pool to swap tokens. \r\n\r\nLiquidity on SpiritSwap is incentivized through yield farming. Users can stake their SPIRIT-LP tokens to earn SPIRIT tokens (a valueless governance token). SPIRIT tokens can be used to vote in the DAO on parameters such as emissions rates, farms to add, farm allocations, and future development. SPIRIT token holders can also earn revenue from the SpiritSwap protocol.",

                "description": "## What Is ShibaSwap?\n\n[ShibaSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/shibaswap/) is the [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) of the Shiba Inu ([SHIB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/)) coin, a popular dog-themed meme coin inspired by the success of Dogecoin and claiming to be a \u201c[Dogecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/) killer.\u201d In November 2021, Shiba Inu briefly surpassed Dogecoin in market capitalization, partly thanks to the DEX. \n\nShibaSwap enables users to provide liquidity and swap different tokens while earning its governance token [BONE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bone-shibaswap/). Users can also trade NFTs, so-called \u201cShibatoshis,\u201d a collection of 10,000 unique tokens related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Other functionalities include [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking), [swapping](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) tokens, collecting rewards, and checking portfolio analytics.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of ShibaSwap?\n\nAfter burning half of its supply to Vitalik Buterin, who then donated his tokens to charity, the Shiba Inu community decided that SHIB would need to set itself apart from other meme coins and started working on ShibaSwap. \n\nSince the founder of Shiba Inu is unknown, the same is true for ShibaSwap. The Shiba Inu community developed the exchange to increase the utility of the SHIB token. Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 by \u201cRyoshi,\u201d a pseudonymous developer. Shiba Inu\u2019s \u201cWoofpaper\u201d explains three reasons for the creation of Shiba Inu: \n\n* \u201cWe started from zero, with zero.\u201d\n* \u201cThe brilliant minds behind Shib had never collaborated before.\u201d\n* \u201cWe love Shiba Inu Dogs.\u201d\n\n### When Was ShibaSwap Launched?\n\nShibaSwap launched on July 6, 2021, to make the cryptocurrency more than a meme coin.\n\n### Where Is ShibaSwap Located?\n\nLike its founder, the location of the exchange remains a mystery.\n\n### ShibaSwap Restricted Countries\n\nThe platform is supposedly open to users from all over the world.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on ShibaSwap?\n\nIn addition to SHIB, LEASH, and BONE, users can swap hundreds of other tokens on the DEX. There are over 230 markets, with the most popular trading pairs being ETH/VEMP, BONE/ETH, and SHIB/ETH.\n\n### How Much Are ShibaSwap Fees?\n\nTraders pay [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas) on the Ethereum network to trade on ShibaSwap.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on ShibaSwap?\n\nMargin trading is not enabled on the decentralized exchange.",

                "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V3) (Optimism)?\n\nUniswap is the largest decentralized trading and automated market-making protocol on Ethereum. Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) is the third iteration of the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)). The platform introduced the concept of [concentrated liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/concentrated-liquidity), which improves the liquidity providing efficiency and makes it easier for some assets to gain exposure. \n\nLiquidity providers (LPs) can also choose where and how they allocate their funds. Notably, LPs can supposedly earn higher rewards on their capital by providing liquidity with up to 4000x capital efficiency relative to Uniswap v2.\n\nAlthough Uniswap V3 is an update to previous versions, users can still trade on [Uniswap V2](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/).\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Uniswap (V3) (Optimism)?\n\nThe decentralized exchange was launched by Uniswap Labs, founded by Hayden Adams.\n\nAdams was an engineer at Siemens. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Stony Brook University in 2016. After leaving Siemens in July 2017, he created the Uniswap protocol in October 2017.\n\n### When Was Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) Launched?\n\nThe Alpha launch of Uniswap v3 on the Optimism Ethereum mainnet was announced on July 13, 2021.\n\n### Where Is Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) Located?\n\nThe company has its headquarters in New York.\n\n### Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) Restricted Countries\n\nThe platform is restricted in countries subject to US sanctions, including Syria, Iran, and Belarus.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on Uniswap (V3) (Optimism)?\n\nUniswap (V3) (Optimism) currently has 20 cryptocurrencies, zero fiat currencies, and 115 crypto trading pairs.\n\n### How Much Are Uniswap (V3) (Optimism) Fees?\n\nThe DEX has a multi-tier fee structure that compensates liquidity providers based on the risk level of their investment. There are three fee categories \u2013 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1%. The fee is based on the volatility of the trading pair. For instance, non-correlated pairs may attract a fee of 0.3% or 1% because they are generally riskier.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Uniswap (V3) (Optimism)?\n\nUniswap (V3) (Optimism) is primarily a DEX for swapping assets. As such, it does not support margin trading.",

                "description": "## What Is Orca?\n\nOrca touts itself as the \"easiest, fastest, and most user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange on the Solana blockchain.\" Being one of the first automated [market makers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-automated-market-makers) (AMM) launched on [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/solana), the decentralized exchange (DEX) maintains its own [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). It allows users to swap assets, participate in yield farming, and provide liquidity.\n\nThe platform leverages Solana\u2019s quick transactions and low fees. On one hand, users can perform low-fee token trades. On the other, they can provide [concentrated liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/concentrated-liquidity) to the platform to earn a share of trading fees.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Orca?\n\nOrca was co-founded by Grace Kwan and Yutaro Mori. Kwan, aka \"Ori,\" is the UX designer. She graduated from Stanford with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science before working as a software engineer at Coursera and a designer at IDEO.\n\nYutaro is the brain behind Orca's core AMM. He has been active in the crypto space since 2017 at the Ethereum Foundation. He worked on the Eth2 Go client and Layer 2 solutions before making a foray into Solana.\n\n### When Was Orca Launched?\n\nThe project launched in February 2021 without external funding. In September 2021, the [total value locked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) (TVL) on the protocol had exceeded $300 million, while its trade volume exceeded $700 million.\n\n### Where Is Orca Located?\n\nThe company is located in New York, United States.\n\n### Orca Restricted Countries\n\nAlthough Orca\u2019s \"Terms of Use Agreement\" did not explicitly name any country as restricted, the company advised users in areas prohibited by the applicable law to desist from using its platform.\n\n### What Coins Are Supported on Orca?\n\nThe DEX supports over 200 markets, with the most popular trading pairs being SOL/USDC, SOL/STSOL, and SOL/MSOL.\n\n### How Much Are Orca Fees?\n\nTrading fees vary depending on the route the AMM uses. The fee structure on the platform is as follows: stable whirlpool \u2013 0.01%, whirlpool \u2013 0.2%, stable pool \u2013 0.07%, and pool \u2013 0.3%. A \"double-hop trade\" such as SOL to USDT to ETH would pay 0.3% to trade SOL to USDT and another 0.3% to trade USDT to ETH.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Orca?\n\nThe decentralized trading platform does not support margin trading.",

                "description": "## What Is Biswap?\n\nBiswap is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) enabling users to swap [BEP-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) tokens on BNB Chain. It uses an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)), allowing users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) with a constant product formula. Furthermore, users can engage in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) and transaction fee mining. For example, miners receive up to 90% of transaction fees on [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) and can earn additional fees in the exchange\u2019s native token. \n\nAnother key product is the [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace, where users can buy NFTs with different cryptocurrencies like [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/), [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [BUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/) and [WBNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wbnb/). They can also buy the exchange\u2019s own NFTs from its NFT Earn program, which is comprised of an NFT launchpad, a staking pool, and tools to boost and upgrade NFTs. This is complemented by the lottery, where prizes in the native token are up for grabs.\n\nFinally, the [IDO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-dex-offering) launchpad provides new projects with a way to raise funding through the exchange by tapping into its more than 300,000 users. Its global incentive program has more than $10 million ready for collaboration with other projects. The funds are allocated as grants for security audits and project development and form part of the exchange\u2019s growth strategy.        \n\n\n## Who Are the Biswap Founders?\n\nBiswap does not provide any information on its founders but lists a team of pseudonymous contributors. The CEO is called \u201cEK\u201d and is a veteran in the crypto industry, according to the official documents. Furthermore, no information on possible investors is provided. \n\n\n## When Did Biswap Launch?\n\nThe exchange launched in July 2021. It quickly established itself as one of the major decentralized exchanges in the BNB ecosystem.\n\n\n## Where Is Biswap Located?\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information available about where the exchange is located. \n\n \n\n\n## Biswap Restricted Countries\n\nThere is no information about possibly blocked or restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n\n## Biswap Supported Coins List \n\nBiswap supports almost all BEP-20 tokens available on BNB Chain.\n\n\n## How Much Are Biswap Fees?\n\nUnlike most other decentralized exchanges that charge 0.3% for token swaps, Biswap only charges 0.1%. Half of the fees are redistributed among liquidity providers and the other half is [burned](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/burned).\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Biswap?\n\nThere is no margin or leverage trading on this exchange.

                "description": "## What Is Osmosis?\n\nOsmosis is an advanced AMM protocol built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-cosmos-network-and-the-cosmos-ecosystem) that will allow developers to design, build, and deploy their own customized AMMs.\n\nHeterogeneity and sovereignty are two core tenets of the Cosmos ecosystem, and Osmosis takes these two values and extends them into core characteristics of this AMM protocol. Rather than aim for a one-size-fits-all homogeneous approach for AMMs and its liquidity pools, Osmosis is designed such that the most efficient solution is reachable through the process of experimentation and rapid iteration by leveraging the wisdom of the crowd. It achieves this by offering deep customizability to AMM designers, and a governance mechanism by which each AMM pool\u2019s stakeholders (i.e. liquidity providers) can govern and direct their pools.\n\nAs a decentralized [P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-peer-to-peer-p2p) protocol, the platform is used for trading tokens and creating [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity). The project conducted an ICO in October 2021. The token sale led by Paradigm Ventures helped the company to raise $21 million.\n\nOsmosis takes two of the core tenets of the Cosmos ecosystem (heterogeneity and sovereignty) and extends them into the core features of its AMM protocol. As such, the protocol utilizes self-governing liquidity pools that allow users to vote on pool parameters and protocols, and provide liquidity, and stake.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Osmosis?\n\nThe DEX was launched by Osmosis Labs, founded by Josh Lee and Sunny Aggarwal. A graduate of Anderson University, Lee was one of the founding employees of Block in Press, a leading Korean blockchain media outlet. Between 2018 and 2019, he worked as the project manager at Lunamint where he curated the first native crypto wallet within the Telegram messenger. He has also functioned as a development analyst at Tendermint.\n\nAs for Aggarwal, he previously worked as a research scientist at Tendermint and is a core developer of the Cosmos SDK and Gaia blockchain. He is also the co-founder of Sikka, a company that works on DeFi protocols and networks.\n\n### When Was Osmosis Launched?\n\nOsmosis launched in June 2021.\n\n### Where Is Osmosis Located?\n\nThe company has its headquarters in Singapore.\n\n### Osmosis Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, it is unable to confirm if users in some regions are restricted from using the platform. \n\n### What Coins Are Supported on Osmosis?\n\nThe DEX platform currently supports swaps between 56 tokens in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n### How Much Are Osmosis Fees?\n\nAlthough swap fees range from 0.1% for direct route swaps to 0.5% for multi-hop Osmo route, most swaps are charged at 0.2% per pool, with a few variations.\n\n### Is it Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trading on Osmosis?\n\nThe DEX does not support margin trading.",

                "description": "## What Is SpookySwap?\n\n[SpookySwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/spookyswap/) is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) on the [Fantom](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/) blockchain. It operates with an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) to provide constant liquidity for traders and allow them to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). It also serves as a bridge between Fantom and other [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain).\n\n[Token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) allow customers to trade one token for another with liquidity in the pools. The exchange offers fees below the industry standard. Users can also add liquidity and earn from the swapping fees on the token pairs where they provided liquidity. With more than 18 token pairs, SpookySwap offers the most diverse [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) opportunities on the Fantom blockchain. \n\nFurthermore, there are single stake pools, where only one token type is needed to stake. In that case, users do not need an LP token and can earn from [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) only the platform\u2019s native [BOO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/spookyswap/) token. This allows them to get more assets and increase their share of fee-earning tokens.\n\nThere is also an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) collection called Magicats, displaying the two mascot cat characters Grim and Ace. \n\nFinally, the exchange offers a [bridge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges) to other blockchains like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/), [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), and [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/). Users require a wallet and gas tokens of the chain they are bridging from. The transactions can take between 10 minutes and 24 hours, depending on the traffic.\n\n\n## Who Are the SpookySwap Founders?\n\nThe SpookySwap founders are anonymous and work in a decentralized manner.\n\n## When Did SpookySwap Launch?\n\nSpookySwap launched in April 2021 and has since earned endorsement and support from the Fantom Foundation and passed more than 50 proposals with its governance token. \n\n## Where Is SpookySwap Located?\n\nSpookySwap does not have one location but works in a decentralized manner.\n\n## SpookySwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n## SpookySwap Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange supports token swaps for all Fantom-based tokens. \n\n## How Much Are SpookySwap Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.2% trading fee, with 0.22% for limit orders. 0.17% of that is returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward and 0.05% is allocated towards stakers. Unlike other DEXes, no money returns to the treasury. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on SpookySwap?\n\nSpookySwap does not offer [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage) or [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading).",

                "description": "## What Is Trader Joe?\n\nTrader Joe is a [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) platform offering several functions like [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) via an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)), [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming), [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) of the native [utility token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/utility-token), borrowing and lending on the integrated [money market](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/money-market) and an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace. The platform is built on [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), an [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible [layer-one blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain). It attracted a lot of growth in 2021 and quickly became an important [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) in the Avalanche ecosystem.\n\nThe exchange stands out with its convenient user interface and cheap and fast transaction execution. Furthermore, users can earn by providing liquidity and staking the native token in one of the yield farms. The token can also be used for [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance). Its lending protocol, called Banker Joe, is a money market protocol, allowing users to borrow and lend funds without giving up their custody of them. \n\nAs part of the yield farming branch of the project, users can earn extra rewards through trading fees and tokens. They can also improve the capital efficiency of their assets and leverage capital that would otherwise be sitting idly in their wallet. Finally. there is also Rocket Joe, a platform that bootstraps protocol-owned liquidity for other projects. \n\n\n## Who Are the Trader Joe Founders?\n\nThe exchange was founded by two pseudonymous developers, called Cryptofish and 0xMurloc. The former is a full-stack and [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) developer and an early contributor to several Avalanche projects. The latter is a full-stack developer with startup experience and a former Senior Product Lead at Grab. Over a dozen other contributors work on marketing and community. \n\n\n## When Did Trader Joe Launch?\n\nThe exchange launched in June 2021 and quickly had a lot of traction, drawing in as much as $4 billion in [total value locked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) at its peak.  \n\n\n## Where Is Trader Joe Located?\n\nThere is no information on Crunchbase about the exchange\u2019s headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## Trader Joe Restricted Countries\n\nTrader Joe does not provide any information about restricted countries. \n\n\n## Trader Joe Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange offers a multitude of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens from the Avalanche ecosystem and wrapped tokens, like [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin) and [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth).  \n\n\n## How Much Are Trader Joe Fees?\n\nThere is a 0.3% fee for token swaps. 0.25% goes to liquidity providers and 0.05% to stakers.\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Trader Joe?\n\nThere is no margin or [leverage trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-leverage-in-crypto-trading-and-how-to-use-it) yet, but the exchange has plans in its [roadmap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/roadmap) to introduce it in the future.",

We constantly test the user experience felt by people who are not really familiar with finance or crypto and keep enhancing the experiences. Coinavenir\u2019s futures may not be in the most technical or most coins. Hence the user base is quite different from other older exchanges.\n\nEvery asset deposited automatically moves into the cold wallet. The movement from cold to hot is processed with shorter period to reduce the danger of security breach.\n\nOnly the users with KYC done are able to trade and withdraw in order to comply.",

                "description": "## What Is SushiSwap (Arbitrum)?\n\n[SushiSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/) is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) with an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (automated market maker). It utilizes [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to enable frictionless trading of different token pairs. Users can create their own token pairs and [provide liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) to them. Initially a [fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fork-software) of UniSwap, another famous DEX, the exchange was one of the earliest to adopt the model of the automated market maker. It sparked a boom and later grew into one of the biggest exchanges in all of [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi). It is currently available on almost all [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) and multiple [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions for [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem) being one of them. \n\nSushiSwap targets DeFi traders and institutions looking for [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) and [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) trading. It has a more egalitarian [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) approach than other exchanges. Its native token can be used for voting on governance proposals.        \n\nOne of the core products is the Bento Box, a token vault that generates yield for the capital deposited into it. Another important product is Kashi, a lending and [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading) platform where anyone can create customized and gas-efficient markets for tokens. With MasterChef V2, the liquidity provision program, the exchange boasts over $1 billion in [TVL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) at the time of writing. Finally, Miso provides projects with access to trading on the platform either through fixed price or dutch auction options. \n\n\n## Who Are the SushiSwap Founders?\n\nChef Nomi, the [pseudonymous](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/pseudonymous) founder of SushiSwap, left the project not long after founding it. He passed management on to another pseudonymous developer, 0xMaki. Later, ownership switched again: that time to Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, a [centralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex). \n\n\n## When Did SushiSwap Launch?\n\nSushiSwap launched in August 2020. \n\n\n## Where Is SushiSwap Located?\n\nAs the exchange is mostly being worked on and developed by anonymous individuals, there is no centralized headquarter. \n\n \n\n\n## SushiSwap Restricted Countries\n\nThere is no information about possibly blocked or restricted countries on this exchange. \n\n\n## SushiSwap Supported Coins List \n\nWith its presence on almost all of the important [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) and [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions, SushiSwap supports almost all [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens on the market.\n\n\n## How Much Are SushiSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges the industry standard of 0.3% for token swaps.\n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on SushiSwap?\n\nSushiswap offers Kashi, a lending and margin trading platform that uses a unique [isolated market](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/isolated-margin) framework.",

                "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum)?\n\n[Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/) is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) that pioneered the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model. The introduction of the AMM allowed users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) offering a constant source of liquidity with its product formula. The V3 version of the exchange presents services to [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solutions. \n\nThe AMM model premiered in the V1 version of the exchange, with the V2 version allowing trading between different [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pairs instead of [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) between [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and ERC-20 tokens. The consequence was reduced [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage), benefiting the evolution of the exchange. Furthermore, it introduced protocol fees to continue development. In the V2 version, [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) instead of native Ether was available for the first time as liquidity for token pairs.\n\nImprovements in the V3 version include unique price curves for [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens), allowing them to centralize their capital at desired prices to improve capital efficiency. Another feature implies the automatic capital removal if prices change significantly and exceed the LP\u2019s price range. The V3 is the first version available on [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem), a scaling solution for Ethereum that opens up a more affordable trading experience thanks to its significantly lower trading fees.  \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum)?\n\nHayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate, founded the decentralized exchange in November 2018. Uniswap Labs, the development company behind the DEX, was financed by [crypto VC funds](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-the-top-crypto-venture-capital-firms) like Paradigm in a Series A, raising $11 million in the round led by \u200b\u200bAndreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V3) (Arbitrum) Launch?\n\nV1 launched in November 2018. The improved V2 version hit the market in August 2020.

It is similar to Uniswap, with a few changes:\n- Multiple pools in a single contract. Traders can trade across pools atomically in a single transaction\n- Customizable LP fees per pool. LPs can charge higher fees for illiquid or highly volatile tokens. Referral fees for swaps, currently set at 1 bps. Developers can earn rewards for building UIs and other applications on top of Ref Finance",

With significantly better performance, the scope of AMMs can be rapidly expanded, giving birth to new market opportunities.",

                "description": "What Is BabyDogeSwap?\nBabyDogeSwap is a popular decentralized exchange (DEX) allowing BEP-20 token swaps on the BNB Chain. It is the biggest exchange of the BNB Chain ecosystem and one of the top community DEXs by the baby doge community. The exchange employs an automated market maker (AMM) model, allowing users to swap against a liquidity pool. You can become a liquidity provider and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the swap fees.\n\nLP token holders can also engage in yield farming to earn BabyDoge, the swap's utility token. The token can be staked in so-called \u2018Farms\u2019 or Pools with flexible or fixed-term staking. When the BabyDoge token is held in your wallet users receive lower swap fees.\n\nWho Are the BabyDogeSwap Founders?\nThe BabyDogeSwap founders are anonymous. The swap is open-source and has been audited by reputable security firm Certik. This is a community first project.\n\nWhen Did BabyDogeSwap Launch?\nBabyDogeSwap launched in October 2022\n\nWhere Is BabyDogeSwap Located?\nAs it is a decentralized exchange, the team works remotely. \n\nBabyDogeSwap Restricted Countries\nThere are no restricted countries or regions since the exchange is decentralized. However, the following countries and regions are geoblocked: Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Crimea, Syria, Sudan, Belarus and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nBabyDogeSwap Supported Coins List\nAll BEP-20 tokens can be traded, such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, and all other big layer-one blockchains.\n\nHow Much Are BabyDogeSwap Fees?\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.30% trading fee, with 0.20% returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward, 0.05% sent to the treasury and 0.05% sent towards a buyback and burn program. However some pairs such as BabyDoge/BNB and other requested pairs have a 0% Swap fee. In addition when holding the BabyDoge token users receive up to 70% OFF per swap giving as low as 0.09% swap fees. Perhaps the lowest swap fees in all of defi !",

                "description": "## What Is Uniswap (V3) Polygon?\n\nUniswap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) that introduced the [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model for the first time in the market. With this innovation, traders tap into a constant pool of liquidity and trade against an algorithm using a constant product formula. With its V3 version, the exchange branched out to blockchains other than [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) for the first time. \n\nAfter the introduction of the AMM model in V1, the V2 version allowed trading between different [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pairs instead of [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) between [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and ERC-20 tokens. This reduced [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) and introduced protocol fees to continue the exchange\u2019s development. The V2 version also introduced [wrapped Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) instead of native Ether as liquidity for token pairs.\n\nIn the V3 version, [liquidity providers ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens)can build unique price curves and centralize their capital at desired prices to improve capital efficiency. It also activated automatic removal of capital if prices change significantly and exceed the LP\u2019s price range. With the introduction of V3, Uniswap also launched on Polygon for the first time. Thanks to its lower gas fees, users can now access a much more affordable trading experience   \n\n\n## Who Is the Founder of Uniswap (V3) Polygon?\n\nThe exchange was founded by Hayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens and Stony Brook University graduate in November 2018. Uniswap Labs, the development company behind the exchange, raised a seed round from Paradigm and $11 million in a Series A round led by \u200b\u200bAndreessen Horowitz.\n\n\n## When Did Uniswap (V3) Polygon Launch?\n\nAfter the launch of the V1 version in November 2018 and the subsequent improvement with the V2 version in August 2020, the V3 version was launched in May 2021. However, the V3 version came out on Polygon only in November 2021.\n\n\n## Where Is Uniswap (V3) Polygon Located?\n\nThe headquarters of Uniswap Labs are in New York City. \n\n\n## Uniswap (V3) Polygon Restricted Countries\n\nUniswap has officially restricted the following countries from using its services: Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n## Uniswap (V3) Polygon Supported Coins List \n\nAs a [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) decentralized exchange, tokens can be freely listed by anyone providing liquidity to trade them. The most liquid tokens, at the time of writing, include [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) and wrapped tokens like [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), [Wrapped BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [wETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) and [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). \n\n\n## How Much Are Uniswap (V3) Polygon Fees?\n\nThe V3 version has a flexible fee mechanism. Stablecoin trading pairs have a fee of 0.05%, standard non-correlated pools like ETH and stablecoins have a fee of 0.3%, and other pairs have a fee of 1%. There is no more protocol fee, although it can be turned on through [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance). \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Uniswap (V3) Polygon?\n\nUniswap V3 does not offer leverage or margin trading.",

                "description": "## What Is Spartan Protocol (SPARTA)?\r\n\r\nSpartan Protocol is a Decentralised Finance (Defi) project built on top of Binance Smart Chain (BSC). With a focus on incentivised liquidity pools and SyntheticYield Assets, Spartan Protocol allows users to earn revenue by providing liquidity to pools and creating derivative tokens through Synthetic Assets.\r\n\r\nNotable similar projects are Uniswap on the Ethereum (ETH) network & and ThorChain. Bringing these features to the BSC network allows users to take advantage of BSC's low gas fees and fast settlements.\r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of Spartan Protocol?\r\nSpartan Protocol was founded by the communities of former Binance Chain projects with a strong vision of decentralisation. At its inception, all SPARTA tokens were acquired by a Proof-of-Burn process of selected BEP20 tokens, thus there isn't any founder/team tokens or treasury. With the use of DAO governance, every token holder has a voice with Spartan Protocol built & run by the community, for the community.\r\n\r\n### What Makes Spartan Protocol Unique?\r\nAt its core, Spartan Protocol provides incentivized liquidity pools that are facilitated by an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm that has liquidity-sensitive fees. The AMM algorithm provides transparency while reducing slippage and latency caused by human intervention/manipulation. With liquidity-sensitive fees, it is ensured that the system will be able to detect correct token purchasing at all times thus resulting in scalable and risk-tolerant growth. Coupled with various other features like Synths, the use cases for the underlying pools increase thus resulting in higher revenue generation with higher APYs.\r\n\r\nSynthetic assets are a fairly unique part of Spartan Protocol, through the generation of synthetic assets, users can create derivative tokens that allow users to go long or short on various markets without having the need to own the particular asset. Synthetic assets are generated through the use of price anchors offered by the liquidity pools on Spartan Protocol and collateralized by liquidity pool shares. The liquidity pool shares are on-market, value-stabilized and can be instantly liquidated. Liquidity-sensitive fees ensure that positions taken up will scale with the depth of the available liquidity, preventing the deleveraging spirals that are common in many similar systems.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan DAO is a mechanism that is used to govern the entire ecosystem and distribute protocol incentives.",

A Dynamic AMM is based on a virtual AMM (vAMM), but its key innovative is that it introduces repegging and adjustable k mechanisms to recalibrate liquidity in a trading pool based on participant demand. DAMMs, as a result, have the ability to be more flexible than traditional vAMMs and AMMs, which lead to better capital efficiency and reduced slippage.",

                "description": "## What Is Jupiter?\n\nAs a liquidity aggregator on [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/), Jupiter aggregates the best token prices across different [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) by connecting all DEX markets and [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) pools together, irrespective of the provider. This smart routing process also compares prices routed through an [intermediary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/intermediary-middleman) token, which allows the discovery of price inefficiencies and volatility in the markets. Jupiter also dynamically splits trades into smaller trade sizes to get better prices for larger size trades and trades with tokens that have shallow liquidity across several exchanges.\n\nOther key features of Jupiter include the automatic listing of new markets as soon as they are launched on Solana, and [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) in a single transaction without exceeding transaction limits and incurring high [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage). Users can simply enter the tokens and size they want to trade and the platform calculates all the possible routes for the token trade.  \n\nFurthermore, its API is a way for developers to access liquidity on Solana: the liquidity is [provided ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens)as a [wrapped](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth) token, enabling liquid swaps across all tokens, including wrapped versions of other protocol tokens.   \n\n\n## Who Are the Jupiter Founders?\n\nJupiter does not provide any information about its founders. However, the exchange lists a set of partner exchanges and [AMMs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm), such as [Saber](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/saber-dex/), [Raydium](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/raydium/), [Serum](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/serum-dex/) and [Penguin Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/penguin-finance/). In total, it has over a dozen partners.   \n\n\n## When Did Jupiter Launch?\n\nThe aggregator launched in October 2021. It has already processed over $20 billion in transaction volume and has made more than 140,000 token swaps across more than 4,100 trading pairs. \n\n\n## Where Is Jupiter Located?\n\nThe exchange does not provide any information about its location. \n\n \n\n\n## Jupiter Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## Jupiter Supported Coins List \n\nJupiter aggregates liquidity for all SPL tokens, as well as non-native tokens from other blockchain ecosystems. Thanks to its integration with several [bridges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges), it aims to become the single-point swap aggregation on Solana.  \n\n\n## How Much Are Jupiter Fees?\n\nThere are no protocol fees on Jupiter. However, the integrators can charge a platform fee for token swaps, which will be passed on to traders. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on Jupiter?\n\nSince Jupiter is a liquidity aggregator and not a [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures) or [spot trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/spot-trading) exchange, it does not offer any margin or leverage trading.

                "description": "##What is Minswap (MIN)?\n\nMinswap is a Decentralized Exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain. For each swap, a fee is taken, which mainly goes to the Liquidity Providers (LPs). LPs on Minswap can stake their LP Tokens to earn MIN Tokens in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming). \n\nMinswap launched in March 2022 and quickly became the DEX with the highest Trading Volume and Total Value Locked ([TVL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl)) on Cardano. Minswap is a community-centric DEX with no private or VC investment. MIN tokens are given to protocol participants and LPs, who can participate in [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) and vote on protocol changes. MIN Token holders are also eligible for swap fee discounts when trading.\n\nMinswap takes advantage of the liquid staking of ADA to stake the ADA deposited in the DEX [Smart Contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), enabling LPs keep earning ADA staking rewards. Minswap offers projects the option to offer their own token rewards in yield farming. As such, in some cases LPs earn 4x rewards (MIN Tokens + ADA staking reward + Project Token + Trading Fees). Lastly, the Minswap Launchbowl, encompasses the initiatives other projects can use to bootstrap their Liquidity on Minswap.\n\n##Who Are the Minswap Founders?\n\nThe Minswap DEX is mainly developed by the Minswap Labs entity, a group of DeFi natives and developers mainly based in Vietnam.\n\n##How much are swap fees on Minswap?\n\nThere is a 0.3% fee for token swaps. 0.25% goes to liquidity providers and 0.05% towards a Fee Switch mechanism. There is a fixed 2 ADA batcher fee that can be reduced depending on how many MIN Tokens the user has in their wallet.\n",

                "description": "## What Is FstSwap?\n\nFstSwap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) for [BEP-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) on the [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/). It uses an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model to enable fast, cheap and frictionless trading. Traders get matched by a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) that [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) can deposit capital into. They receive [LP tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-liquidity-pool-lp-tokens) for doing so and get a share of the trading fees based on their LP tokens. \n\nThe exchange also has a [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) program, which allows staking LP tokens to earn the native token. Different farms have different [APRs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/annual-percentage-rate-apr), but traders have to pay attention to potential [impermanent loss](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss). Liquidity pools on the exchange are called farm pools, elephant pools and combustion pools. Farm pools provide a chance to stake LP tokens of FstSwap and other BEP-20 tokens and receive rewards. Elephant pools also pay staking rewards, while combustion pools enable token [burns](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/burned).  \n\nThe exchange also provides a detailed roadmap with plans to offer fundraising for future token launches, an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) ecosystem, personalized user profiles and lending of LP tokens. \n\n\n## Who Are the FstSwap Founders?\n\nFstSwap does not disclose any information about its founders. From two community AMAs, it can be assumed that the team is based in Asia. The exchange passed a security audit by Certik. In the future, it plans to introduce [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance), where token holders can vote according to their share of native tokens staked.  \n\n\n## When Did FstSwap Launch?\n\nFstSwap launched in April 2022.\n\n\n## Where Is FstSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange does not provide any information about its location. According to information from community AMAs, the team is likely located in Asia. \n\n \n\n\n## FstSwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## FstSwap Supported Coins List \n\nThe exchange supports all BEP-20 tokens. Due to its decentralized nature, users can list new tokens in a permissionless manner, as long as they provide enough liquidity to facilitate trading. \n\n\n## How Much Are FstSwap Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.30% trading fee. The entire transaction fee is distributed back to the AMM liquidity provider. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on FstSwap?\n\nFstSwap does not support leverage or margin trading.

                "description": "## About QuickSwap\n\nQuickSwap is a [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) that runs on Polygon Network to offer cheaper and faster transactions. Its [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) integrates upgradeable [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and renders [intermediaries](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/intermediary-middleman) obsolete. The exchange is based on open-source software and prioritizes decentralization, [censorship resistance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/censorship-resistance) and security. It benefits from ultra-low gas prices compared to Ethereum, as well as fast and simple trading execution.    \n\nAnyone can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) by depositing two tokens into a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). The exchange enables the trading of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens, which are traded according to the constant product formula. The mechanism removes the need for an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) and allows traders to tap into a constant pool of liquidity. \n\nLiquidity providers can passively invest their assets to accumulate trading fees or provide liquidity as a hedge for certain trading strategies. Traders use tools like [token swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) or can deploy arbitrage bots to compare prices across different exchanges. Finally, developers integrate the exchange with different liquidity aggregators or [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hot-wallet).\n\n\n## Who Are the QuickSwap Founders?\n\nQuickSwap was founded by Roc Zacharias, who is also the CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a blockchain marketing and consultancy firm that also acts as an advisor to the exchange. It is furthermore advised by the Matic Foundation, a governing body of the Polygon blockchain. \n\n\n## When Did QuickSwap Launch?\n\nQuickSwap launched in May 2021 with over 96% of the tokens distributed to the community. It is now considered the main decentralized exchange for Polygon, a [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solution for Ethereum. \n\n\n## Where Is QuickSwap Located?\n\nThe exchange doesn\u2019t provide any information about its headquarters.\n\n \n\n\n## QuickSwap Restricted Countries\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no information about restricted countries on this exchange.\n\n\n## QuickSwap Supported Coins List \n\nQuickSwap supports all ERC-20 tokens deployed on Polygon, including wrapped tokens like [wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin). \n\n\n## How Much Are QuickSwap Fees?\n\nThe exchange charges a 0.3% fee for swapping tokens, which is distributed among liquidity providers on a pro-rata basis. \n\n\n## Is It Possible to Use Leverage or Margin Trade on QuickSwap?\n\nThere is no margin or [leverage trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-leverage-in-crypto-trading-and-how-to-use-it) option on this exchange.

                "description": "## What Is PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) is a popular [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEX) allowing [BEP-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-20) [swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) on the [BNB Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/). It is the biggest exchange of the [BNB Chain ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/bnb-chain/) and one of the top DEXs by market share. The exchange employs an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM) model, allowing users to trade against a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). You can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens) and receive LP tokens, which entitle users to a share of the exchange's trading fees.  \n\nLP token holders can also engage in [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) to earn [CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/), the exchange's [utility token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/utility-token). The token can be [staked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) in so-called \u2018Syrup Pools\u2019 with flexible or fixed-term staking. Flexible staking allows users to unstake at any time, while fixed-term staking maximizes yield and locks up tokens for up to 52 weeks.\n\nFurthermore, PancakeSwap (V2) offers a lottery, where users can win prizes in CAKE. On the [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace, collectibles can be traded, and with the NFT Profile System, users can set up personalized profiles. There is also a [perpetual](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/perpetual-contracts) trading exchange, developed in partnership with ApolloX, that offers [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures) trading of several popular token pairs without an expiry date. Users can trade popular token pairs with leverage to enter a bigger position than their account balance. \n\n\n## Who Are the PancakeSwap (V2) Founders?\n\nThe PancakeSwap (V2) founders are anonymous and head a two-dozen strong team of anonymous \"Chefs\" working in the exchange's \"Kitchen.\" The exchange is open-source and has been [audited](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/audit) by reputable security firms like Certik and Slowmist. \n\n\n## When Did PancakeSwap (V2) Launch?\n\nPancakeSwap (V2) launched in September 2020.\n\n\n## Where Is PancakeSwap (V2) Located?\n\nAs it is a decentralized exchange, the team works remotely. However, according to Crunchbase, PancakeSwap has its headquarters in Fukuoka, Japan.\n\n \n\n\n## PancakeSwap (V2) Restricted Countries\n\nThere are no restricted countries or regions since the exchange is decentralized. However, the following countries and regions are geoblocked: Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Crimea, Syria, Sudan, Belarus and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n## PancakeSwap (V2) Supported Coins List \n\nAll BEP-20 tokens can be traded, as well as several popular futures pairs, such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, and all other big [layer-one blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain).\n\n\n## How Much Are PancakeSwap (V2) Fees?\n\nAt the time of writing, token swaps incur a 0.25% trading fee, with 0.17% returned to the liquidity pools as a fee reward, 0.03% sent to the treasury and 0.05% sent towards a buyback and burn program. \n\n\n## Is It Possible To Use Leverage or Margin Trade on PancakeSwap (V2)?\n\nThe perpetual futures exchange allows leverage of up to 150X on the biggest trading pairs and 50X on smaller trading pairs.
